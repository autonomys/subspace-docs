Navigating the internet and being part of a crypto project can be exciting! But it's crucial to use good security practices. This way, we can protect our digital community from cyber attacks, and enjoy our Subspace journey with peace of mind.


## Wallet security

---

:::danger NEVER SHARE YOUR KEYS

Under any circumstances, do not share your 12-word seed phrase or private keys.
:::

### Use strong passwords

:::caution MOST ACCOUNT HACKS HAPPEN BECAUSE OF WEAK OR STOLEN PASSWORDS 

Make sure to make your password long and mix letters, numbers, and special symbols.
:::

One of common hacking methods is called "dictionary attack". It happens when a password consists of common and related words.

Weak password example:
```
PickleRick!
```
Strong password example:
```
hvDn@Hy#Gp5@jC*WH7
```

Another way your password can get stolen is if you use information that can be found online or through social engineering (for example: your name, date of birth, or the city you live in).

Here's how to make a strong password:
* Make it as long as the system allows.
* Use both upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols.
* Don't use personal information.
* Avoid everyday words.

### Use unique passwords

Password leaks happen on various websites. Don't reuse any of your existing passwords for your wallet to increase the security of your assets.

### Use a password manager

Using a password manager is a preferable way to keep your passwords. 

Popular password managers offer the following services:
* Encrypted password storage 
* Strong password generator for new sign-ups 
* Alerts of data breaches
* Free tiers

Example of a recommended password manager: [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/).

### Use a hardware wallet

A hardware wallet is by far the most secure way to store your private keys. Unlike online exchanges and wallets, hardware wallets store keys offline and locally and drastically reduce the chance of being hacked.

The most popular hardware wallets are [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) and [Tresor](https://trezor.io/).
