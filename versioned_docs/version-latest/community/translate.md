# Translation Guide

Welcome to the Subspace Docs translation guide! This guide is here to help you contribute to our goal of making Subspace more accessible and inclusive by providing translations. Subspace Labs is driven by a vision of a decentralized and equitable future, and we believe that overcoming language barriers is crucial to achieving this vision.

## Mission and Vision

Subspace Labs is inherently driven by the vision of a more equitable and decentralized future. We believe that to truly fulfill our vision, we need content that caters to the linguistic diversity of the global community. Thus, the Subspace Labs Translation Initiative is born.

### Our mission
1. Deliver translated versions of our content, empowering visitors worldwide to learn about Subspace Labs in their language.
2. Expand the global Subspace community by onboarding members across language barriers.
3. Facilitate accessible, inclusive sharing of Subspace Labs' information and knowledge.
4. Encourage community members to contribute translations, impacting the ecosystem significantly.
5. Identify, connect with, and mentor passionate contributors who want to be part of the ecosystem.

### Our vision
1. Translate essential content for Subspace community members worldwide.
2. Support knowledge sharing across languages to foster a well-informed and educated Subspace community.
3. Enhance the inclusivity and accessibility of Subspace by demolishing language barriers.

As Nakamoto envisioned a more equitable and decentralized future, Subspace Labs sees a future where language is no longer a barrier but a bridge uniting the global crypto community. We are crafting a universal Subspace where everyone has a voice, a place, and a language.
