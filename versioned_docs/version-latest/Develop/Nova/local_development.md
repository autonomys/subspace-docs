### Setting up a local development environment

**You can always set up a local network to test and deploy your smart contract!**

To establish a full local network, you need to run a local node, a Core-EVM domain, and a farmer.

First, visit the **[Subspace releases](https://github.com/subspace/subspace/releases)** page and download the most up-to-date stable versions of the node and farmer.

:::tip
For each release, there are two versions:

1. skylake: for newer processors from around 2015 and onwards
2. x86-64-v2: for older processors from around 2009 and some older VMs

Older processors/VMs are no longer supported by official releases, but they can still be [compiled manually](https://github.com/subspace/subspace/blob/main/docs/development.md) if desired.
:::

After downloading both files that suit your system, start a node using your preferred terminal. If you want to start an EVM domain on your local machine, you need to specify:

- Your local RPC server port
- Your local web-socket RPC port
You can do this with the following command:

```bash
./your_subspace_node_path --dev --alice --rpc-port 9444 -- --domain-id 3 --dev --rpc-port 8545
```

This will create a local RPC on port **8545**.

Secondly, you need to start a farmer by running the following command:

```bash
 ./your_subspace_farmer_path farm --reward-address [YOUR REWARD ADDRESS] path=tmp-farm,size=100M
```

You can specify the desired plot size, but 100M should be sufficient.

**And thatâ€™s it!** By starting your **local node** and a **farmer**, you have your **local RPC** ready for testing and deploying your smart contracts! You can easily connect your [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) account to the local development network, as well as use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) in order to test and deploy smart contracts on a local network!
