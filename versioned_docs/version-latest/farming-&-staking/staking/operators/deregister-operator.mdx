### Embedded Docs


The following command can be used to explore all parameters and subcommands:


```bash
target/production/subspace-node --help
```


### Build from source

If you prefer to build from the source rather using existing builds, the domain operator node is embedded within the `subspace-node` binary, please refer to [Subspace node](https://github.com/subspace/subspace/blob/main/crates/subspace-node/README.md) for how to build from source.


### Operator deregistration

To deregister an operator on the domain and have your tokens released:

:::info
Only account who registered an operator can deregister it. Make sure to use the same wallet / account to sign the transaction for deregistration. 
:::

#### Operator deregistration using **Subspace Staking interface** (recommended)

1. Proceed to the [Subspace Staking portal](https://staking.subspace.tools) and connect your wallet.

7. Congratulations, your operator was deregistered.

:::info
It can take up to 10 minutes for the operator to be deregistered and disappeared from the page. 
You can check if the operator was deregistered successfully on the [Subspace Subscan portal](https://subspace.subscan.io/extrinsic).
:::

#### Operator deregistration using **PolkadotJS**
Alternatively, you can use the **PolkadotJS** portal to deregister operator. 

1. Proceed to [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer)
2. Make sure to select the correct network at the top-left corner. 
3. Select the account you want to use in `using the selected account`.
4. Select `domains` under `submit the following extrinsic` and choose `deregisterOperator(operatorId)` in the dropdown.

5. Your tokens and tokens of operator `Nominators` will be released after the `lockingPeriod`.
6. To check the locking period you can go to `Developer` -> `Chain state` -> `Constants`.
7. Select `domains` under `selected contant query` and choose `stakeWithdrawalLockingPeriod`. 
8. Click on `+` to run the query.

### Operator Stake Withdrawal

**Operator** stake withdrawal works similarly to **Nominator** stake withdrawal. Refer to [this section](../staking.md#stake-withdrawal-using-polkadotjs) to withdraw your stake.
