:::caution

The Pulsar application is experiencing functional issues when used in conjunction with Gemini 3g. We strongly advise users to switch to the [Advanced CLI](../advanced-cli/cli-prerequisites) method for effective farming on the Subspace Network during this period. Our team is diligently working to resolve these compatibility problems and restore full functionality to Pulsar at the earliest opportunity.

:::caution
Please note that some older processors/VMs are no longer supported by official releases, but can still be compiled manually if needed. Precompiled versions of Pulsar are [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/subspace/pulsar/releases). Find the appropriate binary for your operating system below.
