## Troubleshooting

:::caution

The Pulsar application is experiencing functional issues when used in conjunction with Gemini 3g. We strongly advise users to switch to the [Advanced CLI](../advanced-cli/cli-prerequisites) method for effective farming on the Subspace Network during this period. Our team is diligently working to resolve these compatibility problems and restore full functionality to Pulsar at the earliest opportunity.

If you are facing issues with your node/farmer you can try a few of the following things below, if you are unable to get your issue resolved please check our [Forums](https://forums.subspace.network) to see if your issue may have been solved, if its a new one feel free to post it!

### View your Logs

A good place to start if you are facing trouble is by viewing your logs and seeing if there are any errors or insights that might be available. You can find the location for your logs below:

- **üñºÔ∏è Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local/pulsar/logs`
- **üçé macOS:** `$HOME/Library/Logs/pulsar/`
- **üêß Ubuntu:** `$HOME/.local/share/pulsar/logs`


### Enable Rust Backtrace 

When running the Subspace Network Farmer & Node, sometimes you may encounter an error message that includes a line similar to the following:

```text
Backtrace omitted. Run with RUST_BACKTRACE=1 environment variable to display it.
```

This error message means that Rust (the programming language that Subspace Network Farmer & Node is written in) has encountered a problem and has provided a diagnostic backtrace that can help diagnose the issue. However, by default, the backtrace is not displayed. To see the backtrace, you need to enable the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable.

To enable the `RUST_BACKTRACE` enter the following into your terminal:

- **üñºÔ∏è Windows**(PowerShell): `$Env:RUST_BACKTRACE=1`
- **üçé macOS**: `export RUST_BACKTRACE=1`
- **üêß Ubuntu**: `export RUST_BACKTRACE=1`

Once you have enabled the RUST_BACKTRACE simply rerun the application and you will get additional info upon any errors.
