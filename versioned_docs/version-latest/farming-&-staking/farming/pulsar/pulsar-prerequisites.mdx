### System Requirements

:::caution

The Pulsar application is experiencing functional issues when used in conjunction with Gemini 3g. We strongly advise users to switch to the Advanced CLI method for effective farming on the Subspace Network during this period. Our team is diligently working to resolve these compatibility problems and restore full functionality to Pulsar at the earliest opportunity.

:::danger Farming can be Network Intensive.

Make sure you have a stable network connection. During the plotting phase of farming, it can be network intensive.

This may impact your network usage so please check your network connection if you have a hard data limit.

### Security Considerations

For a secure farming setup, ensure your system is updated, use a secure wallet, configure firewalls properly, and follow network safety protocols. Detailed security practices are available on our [Security Best Practices page](../../../learn/security).

### Crypto Wallet

Before running anything you need to have a wallet where you'll receive testnet coins. There are currently two wallets we suggest using, SubWallet being the preferred route.
- [SubWallet](https://subwallet.app/)
- [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/)

Install one of the two wallets above into your browser and create a new account there.
The address of your account will be necessary at the last step.

For help refer to our forum post [How to setup Subwallet & a Polkadot.js Wallet](https://forum.subspace.network/t/subspace-wallet/61)
- *make sure to follow the Bonus section of the bottom of the post above.*


### Required ports

Currently, a few ports need to be exposed for node to work properly.

If you have a server with no firewall, there is nothing to be done, but otherwise make sure to open the following TCP and UDP ports for incoming connections.

- `30333`
- `30433`
- `30533`

On the desktop side if you have a router in front of your computer, you'll need to forward TCP and UDP ports to the machine on which your node is running (how this is done varies from router to router, but there is always a feature like this, refer to [How to Forward Ports](../additional-guides/port-forwarding) for a more in-depth tutorial).
If you're connected directly without any router, then again nothing needs to be done in such case.
