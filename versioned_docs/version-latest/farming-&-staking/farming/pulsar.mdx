## Pulsar Evolution: Embracing Space Acres GUI

### A Farewell to Pulsar

The journey of the Subspace Network has been one of constant innovation and growth. Pulsar, our initial 'simple' CLI farming application, served as a gateway for many into the world of decentralized farming. It was designed to strike a balance between functionality and ease of use. However, as the network matures and our community's needs evolve, we find ourselves at a crossroads.

In pursuit of delivering the simplest and most accessible farming experience, we are phasing out Pulsar. This decision honors our commitment to ease of use and development efficiency. Pulsar's sunset marks a shift in focus towards a more intuitive and robust GUI application, Space Acres, originally developed as a passion project by Nazar, now an Official Subspace Network application.

### Transitioning to Space Acres GUI and Advanced CLI

- **[Space Acres GUI Application](../farming/space-acres/space-acres-install)**: Space Acres represents the next step in our evolution, offering a graphical user interface that embodies our vision for simplicity without sacrificing the depth of farming features.

- **[Advanced CLI](../farming/advanced-cli/cli-install)**: For those who prefer the command line or require greater configurability, the Advanced CLI remains available, providing granular control over farming operations.

### Why Transition?

- **Streamlined Experience**: Space Acres GUI is the embodiment of simplicity, providing a seamless farming experience with just a few clicks.
- **Development Focus**: Concentrating our efforts on Space Acres allows us to deliver a more polished and sustainable application.
- **Resource Allocation**: By sunsetting Pulsar, we free up valuable development resources to enhance and expand the Subspace Network.

### Support for Our Community

We understand this transition impacts our users, and we are committed to providing support every step of the way:

- **[Subspace Forum](https://forum.subspace.network)**: Our forum is a hub for discussion and community assistance.
- **[Subspace Discord](https://discord.subspace.network)**: Join our Discord for real-time support and to connect with fellow farmers.

We are grateful for your adaptability and support as we navigate this change together.
