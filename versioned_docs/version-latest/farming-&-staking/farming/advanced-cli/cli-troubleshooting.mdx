### Enable Rust Backtrace 

When running the Subspace Network Farmer & Node, you might encounter an error message indicating the need for a Rust backtrace to diagnose issues:

```text
Backtrace omitted. Run with RUST_BACKTRACE=1 environment variable to display it.
```

This message suggests that Rust, the programming language used in Subspace Network Farmer & Node, has encountered a problem. By default, the backtrace is not displayed. To enable the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable and view detailed error information, use the following commands based on your operating system:

- **🖼️ Windows** (PowerShell): Enter `$Env:RUST_BACKTRACE=1` in PowerShell and rerun the application.
- **🍎 macOS**: Type `export RUST_BACKTRACE=1` in the terminal and rerun the application.
- **🐧 Ubuntu**: Enter `export RUST_BACKTRACE=1` in the terminal and rerun the application.
- **⚙ Service (Linux)**: For services, use `sudo systemctl edit subspace-node` or `sudo systemctl edit subspace-farmer`, add `[Service]` and `Environment=RUST_BACKTRACE=1` between the warning comments, reload with `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, and restart services using `sudo systemctl restart subspace-{node,farmer}`.

By enabling `RUST_BACKTRACE`, you can obtain additional diagnostic information to help resolve any errors encountered during operation.
