### Benchmarking Your Farmer
Benchmarking helps you test the plotting speed of your farmer against different versions of the Subspace Network.

```
./subspace-farmer benchmark audit /path/to/your/plot
```

Replace /path/to/your/plot with the actual path to your plot. This will provide you with metrics and insights regarding plotting performance.

### Scrubbing Your Farmer
In certain situations, especially when the farmer terminates unexpectedly or encounters an error, it might fail to restart correctly. The scrub command assists in resolving such issues by cleaning or resetting the specified plot.

```
./subspace-farmer scrub /path/to/your/plot
```

Ensure to replace /path/to/your/plot with your actual plot path. Use this command cautiously as it modifies the plot state to recover from errors.

### Specify Exact CPU Cores for Plotting/Replotting
This option will override any custom logic that the **subspace farmer** might otherwise use.
You can specify the plotting CPU cores by adding `--plotting-cpu-cores`, followed by the desired cores parameters. Cores should be listed as comma-separated values, with whitespace used to separate different thread pools or encoding instances.
For example, `--plotting-cpu-cores 0,1 2,3` will result in two sectors being encoded simultaneously, each using a pair of CPU cores.

Similarly, you can customize the replotting CPU cores using `--replotting-cpu-cores`, followed by arguments similar to those used in the `--plotting-cpu-cores` example above.

Note that setting `--plotting-cpu-cores` requires `--replotting-cpu-cores` to be configured with the same number of CPU core groups. If the `--replotting-cpu-cores` setting is omitted, the node will default to using the same thread pool as for plotting.


### Switching to a new snapshot from older/different versions of Subspace

:::info
Unless specifically mentioned by the Development team you should **NOT** have to wipe your configuration on new releases.
:::

In general you should be able to download the latest release, and re-start the Node & Farmer with the same commands as you started to prior version with no errors.

There are some cases where version updates will cause issue with your Node & Farmer and you may have to wipe your node, typically when errors occur. If you have any issues you can always check our [Forums](https://forums.subspace.network) and hop in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/subspace-network) Server to ask for help.

### Wipe

If you were running a node previously, and want to switch to a new network, please perform these steps and then follow the guide again:
```bash
# Replace `FARMER_FILE_NAME` with the name of the farmer file you downloaded from releases
./FARMER_FILE_NAME wipe PATH_TO_FARM
# Replace `NODE_FILE_NAME` with the name of the node file you downloaded from releases
./NODE_FILE_NAME wipe NODE_DATA_PATH
```
It does not matter if the node/farmer executable is the previous one or from the new snapshot, both will work.

Now follow the installation guide from the beginning.

### Docker Wipe

In case of Docker setup run `docker compose down -v` (and manually delete custom directories if you have specified them).

Now follow the installation guide.

If you are having issues with running a node or farmer for Subspace, feel free to join our Discord or even better you can take a look at our forums and review existing questions or post a new one if needed!

### Help

There are extra commands and parameters you can use on farmer or node, use the `--help` after any other command to display additional options.

```bash
# Replace `FARMER_FILE_NAME` with the name of the node file you downloaded from releases
./FARMER_FILE_NAME farm --help
```

### Timekeepers

Gemini-3g introduces Proof-of-Time and a new, optional role has been added to the node. Timekeepers help run PoT to ensure the security of the network. Timekeeping requires a high-performance core CPU but can be undertaken by any node runner. You can enable timekeeping with the following commands. 
- `--timekeeper`: To enable timekeeping on the node
- `--timekeeper-cpu-cores`: To specify which cores the Timekeeper will run on.

### Node & Farmer Commands Guide

Both the node and the farmer have a variety of flags and parameters. To see a full list, append the `--help` flag to either the node or the farmer command.

### Common Command Examples

:::note Farming Changes
Please note that as of `Gemini-3g` farming no longer occurs while plotting. This is to ensure the plotting process occurs in the most efficient manner. You can change this by adding the `--farm-during-initial-plotting` flag to the farmer. 
:::

For both the node and the farmer, here are some frequently used commands:

- Display farm information: `./FARMER_FILE_NAME info PATH_TO_FARM`
- Scrub the farm for errors: `./FARMER_FILE_NAME scrub PATH_TO_FARM`
- Erase all farmer-related data: `./FARMER_FILE_NAME wipe PATH_TO_FARM`
- Erase all node-related data: `./NODE_FILE_NAME wipe NODE_DATA_PATH`

### Utilizing Multiple Disks

To maximize storage capabilities, you can engage multiple disks directly. This is often more efficient than relying on RAID configurations:

Example:
```shell-session
./FARMER_FILE_NAME farm --reward-address WALLET_ADDRESS \
    path=/media/ssd1,size=100GiB \
    path=/media/ssd2,size=10T \
    path=/media/ssd3,size=10T
```

### Optimizing DSN Syncing

:::warning Parameters to Use with Caution
While it might be tempting to adjust certain parameters that seem related to DSN Syncing, it's advised to be cautious. Some options will not enhance syncing and are best left at their default values:

```
--out-peers
--in-peers
--dsn-target-connections
--dsn-pending-in-connections
--dsn-in-connections
```
:::

#### Recommended Parameters

The default parameters are set with the capabilities of common consumer modem/routers in mind. Adjusting certain parameters could enhance DSN sync performance by increasing parallelism. However, if you decide to increase them significantly, ensure that your modem/router is performant enough to handle the increased traffic.

**Node:**
```
--dsn-out-connections
--dsn-pending-out-connections
```

**Farmer:**
Increasing the values of the farmer parameters could increase the plotting speed.
```
--out-connections
--pending-out-connections
```


### NUMA Support

:::note
NUMA support will benefit farmers with large, powerful CPUs and lots of RAM available. The required RAM amount depends on the processor and the number of threads.  
:::

Previously plotting/replotting thread pools were created for each farm separately even though only a configured number of them can be used at a time (by default just one).
With the introduction of NUMA support, the farmer application has a thread pool manager that will create a necessary number of thread pools that will be allocated to currently plotting/replotting farms. 
When a thread pool is created, it is assigned to a set of CPU cores and will only be able to use those cores. Pinning doesnâ€™t pin threads to cores 1:1, instead, the OS is free to move threads between cores, but only within CPU cores allocated for the thread pool. This will ensure plotting for a particular sector only happens on a particular CPU/NUMA node.

#### Enabling NUMA on Windows/Linux machines

On Linux and Windows, the farmer will detect NUMA systems and create a number of thread pools that correspond to the number of NUMA nodes. This means the default behavior will change for large CPUs and consume more memory as a result, but that can be changed to the previous behavior with CLI options if desired.
To use NUMA, you need to enable it via the BIOS of your motherboard for the farmer to know it exists. This option is present in motherboards for **Threadripper/Epyc processors** but might exist in others too. If you donâ€™t enable it, both OS and farmer will think you have a single UMA processor and will not be able to apply optimizations.
