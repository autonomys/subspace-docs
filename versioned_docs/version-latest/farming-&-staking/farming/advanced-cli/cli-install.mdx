:::tip 
[Releases](https://github.com/subspace/subspace/releases) section on our GitHub is the best place to get fresh releases of binaries and check out the source code.

:::caution Multiple Versions

There are multiple versions of our releases available below. 
 **Skylake:** Ideal for Intel Skylake (6th Generation) and newer CPUs, including AMD's equivalents. Suitable for systems with x86-64-v3 architecture, typically those manufactured after 2014.
 **Legacy:** Best for Intel Broadwell (5th Generation) and older CPUs, as well as AMD's equivalents. Designed for x86-64-v2 architecture, generally found in systems produced before 2014.

## Get Started with Advanced CLI Installation

We will download two files for your respective operating system.
1. `Subspace-Node` - This is the executable that actually makes the connection with the Subspace Network
2. `Subspace-Farmer` - This is the executable that will actually farm for rewards on your allocated storage plots.

:::note
Starting with the February 19th release, we've **enhanced plotting performance** by increasing internal concurrency. This enhancement leads to improved CPU utilization and increased RAM usage. If you prefer to revert your farmer to its previous behavior, you can use the flag `--record-encoding-concurrency 1`.
