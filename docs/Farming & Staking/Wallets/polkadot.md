:::note

Polkadot.js is a Substrate/EVM wallet created by the creators of Substrate & Polkadota/Kusama the [Parity Team](https://www.parity.io/).

:::

This is the barebones wallet. This is because it is the barebones Substrate wallet that supports all Substrate based networks. This is an extension that works similarly to MetaMask, or most other browser based wallets you’ve likely used in the past.

## Create A New Wallet

1. Visit the [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) Website and Download your respective version. 

    :::tip
    The Chrome option will work on all Chromium based browsers such as Brave, Vivaldi, & Edge
    :::

2. Once extension is installed, Open it and click `+`, & `Create new account`

    ![step-2](/img/doc-imgs/polkadot/step-2.png)

3. The extension will then show you your 12-word mnemonic seed.
