## Translation Guide

Welcome to the Autonomys Network Docs translation guide! This guide is here to help you contribute to our goal of making the Autonomys Network more accessible and inclusive by providing translations. The Autonomys Network is driven by a vision of a decentralized and equitable future, and we believe that overcoming language barriers is crucial to achieving this vision.

### Mission and Vision

The Autonomys Network is driven by the vision of a more equitable and decentralized future. We believe that to truly fulfill our vision, we need content that caters to the linguistic diversity of the global community. Thus, the Autonomys Network Translation Initiative is born.

### Our Mission
1. Deliver translated versions of our content, empowering visitors worldwide to learn about Autonomys Labs in their language.
2. Expand the global Autonomys community by onboarding members across language barriers.
3. Facilitate accessible, inclusive sharing of Autonomys Labs' information and knowledge.
4. Encourage community members to contribute translations, impacting the ecosystem significantly.
5. Identify, connect with, and mentor passionate contributors who want to be part of the ecosystem.

### Our Vision
1. Translate essential content for Autonomys community members worldwide.
2. Support knowledge sharing across languages to foster a well-informed and educated Autonomys community.
3. Enhance the inclusivity and accessibility of Autonomys by demolishing language barriers.

As Nakamoto envisioned a more equitable and decentralized future, Autonomys Labs sees a future where language is no longer a barrier but a bridge uniting the global crypto community. We are crafting a universal Autonomys where everyone has a voice, a place, and a language.
