## Introduction to the Auto SDK
Welcome to the Auto SDK documentation! The Auto SDK is a comprehensive toolkit designed to simplify the development of applications and integrations with the Autonomys Network. It provides a set of modular packages that enable developers to interact seamlessly with the consensus chain and active domains (Auto ID, Nova)

### What is the Auto SDK?
The Auto SDK is a collection of JavaScript/TypeScript packages that abstract away the complexity of blockchain interactions. It includes utilities for consensus interactions, identity management, and general-purpose functions that are essential for building decentralized applications (dApps) and services on the Autonomys Network.

### Key Features:
- **Modular Architecture**: Use only the packages you need.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies blockchain operations with high-level functions.
- **Flexibility**: Suitable for both beginners and experienced blockchain developers.
- **Community-Driven and Open-source**.

### Why Use the Auto SDK?
- **Simplify Development**: Focus on your application's logic rather than blockchain intricacies.
- **Accelerate Time-to-Market**: Reduce development time with ready-to-use functions.
- **Ensure Compatibility**: Stay up-to-date with the latest Autonomys blockchain protocols.
- **Enhance Security**: Utilize well-tested code for critical operations like identity management.

### Getting Started
This guide will help you set up the Auto SDK locally and run it against a current public testnet (Gemini 3h), or a local instance of Autonomys node for testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed.
- **Yarn 4**: The project uses Yarn Berry (Yarn 4) as the package manager.

### Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `packages/auto-utils`: Utility functions for the SDK.
- `packages/auto-consensus`: Consensus-related functions.
- `packages/auto-id`: Identity management functions.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**. 

Open your terminal and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/autonomys/auto-sdk.git
```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**.

```bash
cd auto-sdk
```

3. **Set Yarn to Use the Berry Version**.

```bash
yarn set version berry
```

4. **Install Dependencies**.

```bash
yarn install
``` 

### Build and Test

**Build All Packages**: to compile all packages, run:

```bash
yarn run build
```

**Run Tests** 
To execute tests for all packages:

```bash
yarn run test
```

## Localhost Testing 
    You can test the SDK packages against a local Autonomys node using the provided scripts instead of a public testnet (**Gemini 3h**).

### Steps
1. **Verify OS and Architecture Settings**. 

    Edit the **scripts/download.sh** file and ensure that lines 3-7 match your current operating system and architecture:

    ```bash
    # Change the following variables as needed
    # OS to download
    OS="macos" # Options: macos | ubuntu | windows
    # Architecture to download
    ARCHITECTURE="aarch64" # Options: aarch64 | x86_64-skylake | x86_64-v2
    ```

2. **Run the Development Script**.

    Execute the following command to start the local node and farmer:

    ```bash
    node scripts/run-dev.js
    ```

    This script will:

    1. Download the latest version of the node and farmer compatible with your OS and architecture (scripts/download.sh).
    2. Start the Node and create/insert the keystore (scripts/run-node.sh).
    3. Start the Farmer (scripts/run-farmer.sh).
    4. Register the Node as an operator, wait for synchronization, and then terminate the node and farmer (handled within scripts/run-dev.js).
    5. Restart the Node as an operator (scripts/run-operator.sh).
    6. Restart the Farmer (scripts/run-farmer.sh).

**Run Tests Against the Local Node**

```bash
bash scripts/localhost-run-test.sh
```

The tests will automatically detect the local node and farmer, executing against them instead of the public testnet.

## Next Steps

With the Auto SDK set up locally, you're ready to start building and testing your blockchain applications. Explore the additional pages for the code examples and functions overview.
