Domain nodes can be configured in different ways to perform various functions. Nodes are launched with the CLI Application.

## Domain Nodes

Domains are essentially built-in rollups that support any conceivable state transition framework and smart contract execution environment through custom runtimes. Deploying a domain as easy as deploying a smart contract. They allow builders to easily launch their own network without bootstrapping a new validator set, while still benefiting from the shared security and interoperability provided by the Autonomys Network consensus chain.

There are also two ways to configure a Domain node. One is for **Full nodes** and one for **Archive nodes**. 

:::info
To configure the domain part of the node, you need to include a line that is just two dashes `--`. That will tell the CLI that anything after those dashes applies to the domain portion.

### Full Domain Node

A domain full node processes all blocks and serves peers. It preserves the blockchain's state and recent history. 

:::tip Replace these placeholders
- `<BASE_PATH>`: Path where you want to store the node database
- `<DOMAIN_ID>`: The domain ID you want to connect to
:::

```bash
./subspace-node-ubuntu-x86_64-skylake-mainnet-2025-aug-20 run \
--chain mainnet \
--base-path "<BASE_PATH>" \
--blocks-pruning archive \
--state-pruning archive \
--sync full \
-- \
--domain-id "<DOMAIN_ID>"
```

### Archive Domain Node

A domain archive node allows an RPC user to query any historical blocks on the domain it targets. It is useful when a complete history of the domain needs to be made available. An example use case would be indexing the domain chain via RPC.

:::tip Replace these placeholders
- `<BASE_PATH>`: Path where you want to store the node database
- `<DOMAIN_ID>`: The domain ID you want to connect to
- `<RPC_PORT>`: The RPC port you want your node to be accessible at

By default the RPC port is 9944 so you can leave the `rpc-listen-on` out. If you want to change it, you can set it to `0.0.0.0:"<RPC_PORT>"`
:::

```bash
./subspace-node-ubuntu-x86_64-skylake-mainnet-2025-aug-20 run \
--chain mainnet \
--base-path "<BASE_PATH>" \
--blocks-pruning archive \
--state-pruning archive \
--sync full \
-- \
--domain-id "<DOMAIN_ID>" \
--blocks-pruning archive \
--state-pruning archive \
--rpc-methods unsafe \
--rpc-cors all \
--rpc-listen-on 0.0.0.0:"<RPC_PORT>"
```

## Specialized Nodes

### Operator Node

An operator node is closer to an *archive domain node* rather than a *full domain node*. The differences are that `archive-canonical` can be used and the `state-pruning` is set to 28,800 blocks. Also you need to specify a `--domain-id` and an `--operator-id`.

:::tip Replace these placeholders
- `<NAME>`: Your node name for telemetry
- `<BASE_PATH>`: Path where you want to store the node database
- `<DOMAIN_ID>`: The domain ID you want to operate on
- `<OPERATOR_ID>`: Your operator ID (obtained after registration)
:::

```bash
./subspace-node-ubuntu-x86_64-skylake-mainnet-2025-aug-20 run \
--chain chronos \
--name "<NAME>" \
--base-path "<BASE_PATH>" \
--sync full \
-- \
--domain-id "<DOMAIN_ID>" \
--operator-id "<OPERATOR_ID>" \
```
