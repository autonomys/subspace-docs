:::warning Protect Your Cryptocurrency Recovery Phrase at All Costs
Your recovery phrase (also known as a seed phrase) is the master key to your cryptocurrency wallet. Anyone with access to this phrase can take complete control of your funds. Never share it with anyone, never store it in unsecured digital platforms or emails, and always ensure you have a safe offline backup. Treat it like your most sensitive personal or financial information. *If it’s exposed or lost, you could permanently lose access to your cryptocurrency*.
