## Connect to Autonomys Network via RPC

Sometimes you won't see the network you would like to connect to in a list of available networks. In this case you can connect to Autonomys Network manually via RPC.

This also can be helpful for in-development networks such as the Autonomys Network Testnet. Below you will find a simple guide on how to add these new networks. Additionally we will try and keep an updated list of active RPC endpoints below for development.

<details>
<summary>üìù RPC endpoints</summary>
#### Consensus (Mainnet)
```
    wss://rpc.mainnet.subspace.foundation/ws
```

#### Consensus (Taurus Testnet)
```
    wss://rpc.taurus.subspace.foundation/ws
```

#### Auto EVM (Taurus)
```
    wss://auto-evm.taurus.autonomys.xyz/ws
    wss://nova-1.gemini-3h.subspace.network/ws
```

#### Auto ID
```
    wss://autoid-0.gemini-3h.subspace.network/ws
``` 
</details>



1. Open SubWallet, select the 3 line menu in the top left of the wallet.

    ![rpc-step-1](/img/doc-imgs/subwallet/rpc-1.png)

2. Inside the settings menu you will see the option to Manage Networks.

    ![rpc-step-2](/img/doc-imgs/subwallet/rpc-2.png)
    
3. Within the Manage Networks menu you will see a + in the top right corner.

    ![rpc-step-3](/img/doc-imgs/subwallet/rpc-3.png)

4. This will open the Import Network menu, where you will see a few options
- Provider URL
- Network Name
- Symbol
- Block explorer
- Crowdloan URL

The only required option is the Provider URL. Adding an explorer is optional. The default block explorer for the Autonomys Network is [Astral Block Explorer](https://astral.autonomys.xyz).

You can refer to the *RPC Endpoints* above for available provider URLs for the Autonomys Network.
    
5. Fill in the provider URL, once you click out of this box it will check the URL and add the rest of the information, then click Save. 
    - *In this example we will be using the Taurus Testnet RPC `wss://rpc.taurus.subspace.foundation/ws`*

    ![rpc-step-4](/img/doc-imgs/subwallet/rpc-4.png)

6. You will then be taken back to the network screen where you can then select your new network that was added.
