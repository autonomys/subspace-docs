:::note
Currently, the domain chain does not support syncing from other operator nodes; it needs to be deterministically derived from the consensus chain block by block.
:::

### Check the list of the available domains:
In order to participate in block production, operator needs to register on a specific domain. 

:::note
Any account with the **minimum operator stake** can become an operator. 
:::

To check the list of available domains: 
1. Proceed to [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer)
2. Make sure to select the correct network at the top-left corner.
3. Go to Developer -> Chain state
![Staking-1](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/Staking-1.png)
4. Select `domains` under `selected state query` and choose `domainRegistry`
5. Exclude `option`
6. Click on `+` to query the chain state.
![Staking-2](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/Staking-2.png)
7. Review the list of available domains
![Staking-3](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/Staking-3.png)
:::tip
In the example above the number 3 corresponds to the domainId. 
The example is not Stake Wars specific, the operator is responsible for finding out the correct domain ID they want to operate on. **Stake Wars are using the domain with ID 1**.
:::

### Start the domain operator node

#### Create operator key (recommended way)

An operator needs a key pair to participate in bundle production.

1. Make sure to have [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).
You can run `docker -v` in the terminal of your choice to make sure it's installed. 
2. Start a developer node by running
`./target/release/subspace-node --chain dev -- --domain-id 0 --keystore-path tmp/keystore --rpc-cors all`

:::tip
You can use any chain to generate a keypair, we recommend using a `dev` chain for simplicity. 
You can adjust the `--keystore-path` if you prefer to generate the keys in a different location.  
:::

3. Start a local polkadot interface portal by running a docker container.

`docker run --rm -it --name polkadot-ui -e WS_URL=ws://0.0.0.0:9945 -p 80:80 jacogr/polkadot-js-apps:latest`

4. Proceed to the browswer and type `localhost` in the search bar. You should be taken to the polkadot portal. 

![RPC-2](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/RPC-2.png)

5. Navigate to `developer` -> `rpc calls`

6. Select `author` in `call the selected endpoint` and pick a `rotateKeys()` in the dropdown.

![RPC-3](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/RPC-3.png)

7. Press on `Submit RPC call`.

8. You will see a newly generated key on the screen. The key will also be written in a `keystore` location you specified earlier. 

:::tip
You will use this key in order to register an operator later.
:::

The domain operator node is running with an embedded consensus node, thus you need to specify the args for both the consensus node and the domain operator node:

```bash
subspace-node [consensus-chain-args] -- [domain-args]
```

Example:
Start a node as operator on `gemini-3g` chain:

:::info
You need to wipe (`purge-chain`) and sync your node from genesis block, since you need to sync both consensus and domain chains.
You do not need to wipe any existing plots. 
:::

:::note
Ensure you replace `your_domain_id` with your domain identifier in the command and `your_operator_id` with your operator_id. If your keystore is located in a different folder, adjust the `--keystore-path` accordingly. Setting `--base-path` is optional.
:::

:::tip
You can ignore setting up `your_operator_id` while you're syncing your node. Make sure to set it after syncing and registration.
:::

:::tip
Stake Wars are using the domain **Nova** with ID **1**.

### Register an operator on domain

:::info
It's crucial to fully sync your node before registering as an operator. Please follow the commands in the ***Start the domain operator*** node section and only register as an operator once your node is fully synced. If many operators are registered but their nodes are still syncing or offline, it can adversely affect the speed of block production in the domain.

#### Register an operator using Subspace Staking interface (recommended)
1. Proceed to the [Subspace Staking portal](https://staking.subspace.tools) and connect your wallet.

![NStaking-1](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-1.png)

2. Select the wallet you would like to connect. Both **Subwallet** and **PolkadotJS** wallets are supported.

![NStaking-2](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-2.png)

3. Enter your password to give an access to your wallet.

![NStaking-3](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-3.png)

4. Select the account you'd like to use form the dropdown menu. You will see both available and locked (staked) token balances for each account. 

![NStaking-4](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-4.png)
5. Proceed to the `Stake as a pool operator` tab.

![NStaking-5](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-5.png)
6. Select the `domainId` you would like to be registered on. Enter the `Minimum Operator Stake`, `Amount to Stake`, `Nomination Tax` and `Signing key` and then click `Next`.

![NStaking-6](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-6.png)

:::info
Make sure to use the signing key generated on the previous **[Create operator key](#create-operator-key)** step.
:::
7. Approve the request in the pop-up window. 

![NStaking-8](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-7.png)
8. Congratulations, you're now registered as an **operator**! 

![NStaking-8](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-8.png)

:::info
It can take up to 10 minutes for the operator to be registered and appear on the page. 
You can check if the operator was created successfully by following the [steps](#checking-your-operatorid).
:::

:::tip
You can view some additional actions by clicking on `action` next to your operator. 
You can increase your stake, withdraw some stake and de-register your operator from there. 
:::

#### Register an operator using PolkadotJS interface

Alternatively, you can use **PolkadotJS** to register an operator on the domain. 
To register an operator on the domain: 
1. Proceed to [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer)
2. Make sure to select the correct network at the top-left corner. 
3. Navigate to Developer -> Extrinsics. 
4. Select the account you want to use in `using the selected account`.
5. Select `domains` under `submit the following extrinsic` and choose `registerOperator(domainID, amount, config)` in the dropdown.
6. Enter the `domainId` to be registered on. 
7. Enter the desired staking amount in the `amount` field.
8. Put your public signing key at the `signingKey` field. 


:::note
In the example below, 1 TSSC is selected for staking. 18 zeros are added because of the `u128` type, so make sure to put 1000000000000000000 instead. 
:::


![Staking-5](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/Staking-5.png)

:::info
Make sure to use the signing key generated on the previous **[Create operator key](#create-operator-key)** step 
:::

8. Enter `minimumNominatorStake` - in the example, it's set to `1 TSSC`.
9. Enter `nominatorTax` - in the example, it's set to `5%`.
10. Sign and submit the transaction to register an operator.

![Staking-6](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/Staking-6.png)

:::info
Make sure to select **Submit Transaction** since the transaction needs to be signed.
:::

Once registered, the operator has to wait until the domain epoch is complete to start operating for the **domain**, participate in **bundle production**, and **receive rewards**.

Once the domain epoch is finished, the operator can produce bundles from the new epoch.

Any **operator** can add more stake by using the same functionality.

### Checking your operatorId

There are two ways to check your operatorId: 

1. You can use PolkadotJS **[Network Explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer)**.

![Staking-7](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/Staking-7.png)
2. Browse the **recent events** and you should see **domains.OperatorRegistered** event.

![Staking-8](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/Staking-8.png)
3. Click on the dropdown arrow to view the **domainId** and **operatorId**.

---

Alternatively, you can use [Subscan](https://subspace.subscan.io/) which is a little easier to navigate for this job. 
1. Navigate to **[Subspace Subscan](https://subspace.subscan.io/)** portal.
2. Click on `Blockchain` -> `Extrinsics`.

![Staking-9](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/Staking-9.png)

3. Scroll to the bottom of the page to view all recent events, search for `register_operator` event.

![Staking-10](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/Staking-10.png)

4. Click on `Extrinsic ID` for the desired event.

5. Scroll to `Parameters` and ensure that `signing_key` corresponds to your signing key.

![Staking-11](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/Staking-11.png)

6. Scroll to `Events` and click on dropdown arrow for `domains(OperatorRegistered)`.

![Staking-12](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/Staking-12.png)

7. Inspect and remember your `domain_id`. 

### Embedded Docs


The following command can be used to explore all parameters and subcommands:


```bash
target/production/subspace-node --help
```


### Build from source

If you prefer to build from the source rather using existing builds, the domain operator node is embedded within the `subspace-node` binary, please refer to [Subspace node](https://github.com/subspace/subspace/blob/main/crates/subspace-node/README.md) for how to build from source.


### Operator deregistration

To deregister an operator on the domain and have your tokens released:

:::info
Only account who registered an operator can deregister it. Make sure to use the same wallet / account to sign the transaction for deregistration. 
:::

#### Operator deregistration using **Subspace Staking interface** (recommended)

1. Proceed to the [Subspace Staking portal](https://staking.subspace.tools) and connect your wallet.

![NStaking-1](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-1.png)

2. Select the wallet you would like to connect. Make sure to select the wallet you registered your operator with. Both **Subwallet** and **PolkadotJS** wallets are supported.

![NStaking-2](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-2.png)

3. Enter your password to give an access to your wallet.

![NStaking-3](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-3.png)

4. Click on `Manage your stake`.

![NStaking-9](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-9.png)

5. Click on `Action` button next to an operator you would like to deregister and select `deregister`. 

![NStaking-10](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-10.png)

6. Approve the request in the pop-up window. 

![NStaking-8](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-7.png)

7. Congratulations, your operator was deregistered.

:::info
It can take up to 10 minutes for the operator to be deregistered and disappeared from the page. 
You can check if the operator was deregistered successfully on the [Subspace Subscan portal](https://subspace.subscan.io/extrinsic).
:::

#### Operator deregistration using **PolkadotJS**
Alternatively, you can use the **PolkadotJS** portal to deregister operator. 

1. Proceed to [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer)
2. Make sure to select the correct network at the top-left corner. 
3. Select the account you want to use in `using the selected account`.
4. Select `domains` under `submit the following extrinsic` and choose `deregisterOperator(operatorId)` in the dropdown.

![Staking-14](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/Staking-14.png)

5. Your tokens and tokens of operator `Nominators` will be released after the `lockingPeriod`.
6. To check the locking period you can go to `Developer` -> `Chain state` -> `Constants`.
7. Select `domains` under `selected constant query` and choose `stakeWithdrawalLockingPeriod`. 
8. Click on `+` to run the query. 

![Staking-15](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/Staking-15.png)

:::info
Number 256 above corresponds to the number of the domain blocks, and not the consensus chain blocks. 
:::


### Operator Stake Withdrawal

**Operator** stake withdrawal works similarly to **Nominator** stake withdrawal. Refer to [this section](./staking.md#stake-withdrawal-using-polkadotjs) to withdraw your stake. 

### Create operator key (alternative, less secure way):
An operator needs a key pair to participate in bundle production.
You can create a key using the following command:

```bash
target/production/subspace-node key generate --scheme sr25519
```

![Staking-4](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/Staking-4.png)

Back up the key. Take the `public key (hex)` of the Keypair. The public key is part of the operator config we will be using later on [Staking portal](https://staking.subspace.tools) or [PolkadotJS portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer).

#### Insert key to Keystore:
The key generated above needs to be added to the Keystore so that the operator node can use it to participate in bundle production.

To insert the key, use the following command:

```bash
target/production/subspace-node key insert \
--suri "<Secret phrase>" --key-type oper --scheme sr25519 --keystore-path /keystore
```

The command above assumes `/keystore` as the keystore location.
`suri` is the secret phrase of the operator key.

:::tip
`tmp` folder on linux based systems will be emptied upon the system reboot. Make sure to store the keypair in a secure and permanent location.  
:::

### Switch domains

Any **Operator** can switch domain they operate on anytime. 
In order to switch domain:

1. Proceed to [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer)
2. Make sure to select the correct network at the top-left corner. 
3. Select the account you want to use in `using the selected account`.
4. Select `domains` under `submit the following extrinsic` and choose `switchDomain(operatorId, newDomainId)` in the dropdown.
5. Add your `operatorId` and `newDomainId` to the corresponding fields. 

![Staking-24](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/Staking-24.png)

:::note

Only the account who registered **Operator** can swith the domain.

:::

:::note

Stake of your **Nominators** won't be released, but will be moved to the new domain as well. 

:::


## Useful commands
### Running both validator (farmer) and operator nodes at the same time

:::tip
To run both operator and validator at the same time, provide requrired flags for both roles when starting your node.

You should see the node start successfully and begin syncing. 

![Staking-28](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/Staking-28.png)

### Switching to another server
To ensure the minimum downtown during your switch, we propose the following: 

1. Sync a new operator node using a throwaway key. You can generate a new key, just not insert it into your keystore. 
2. Stop the original node and rename the keystore (or whatever you feel comfortable doing to prevent you accidentally starting the original node up with the original signing key).
3. Update the keystore on the new node with the original signing key.
4. Restart the new operator node.
