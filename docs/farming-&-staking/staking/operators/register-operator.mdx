## Download Subspace Node

Download `Subspace Node` for your respective operating system.

:::info Taurus Network Only
Currently, only running and registering an operator on the Taurus test network is supported.

### Choosing the right domain

An operator needs to register on a specific domain and create a key pair to participate in bundle production. Autonomys is currently using `domain 0` for the EVM domain. 
More domains will be available in the future. It is possible to register an operator for each domain, but each operator will require running its own node. 
Currently operators can only be registered on the Taurus network.

:::tip
Any account with the **minimum operator stake of 100 tAI3** can become an operator. 
:::

### Create operator key

An operator needs a key pair to participate in bundle production.

To create a new operator key, run the following command:
`subspace-node domain key create --base-path NODE_DATA_PATH --domain-id DOMAIN`

Make sure to specify the base **--base-path** for the key generation, and running an operator node and make sure to replace the value in **--domain-id** with the domain ID you would like to be an operator on.

:::tip
The operator is responsible for finding out the correct domain ID they want to operate on.
:::

**You have successfully generated an operator key, congratulations!**

:::note
Be sure to record and securely store the printed seed phrase. If it is leaked or stolen, both your operator and nominator stakes could be at risk of being slashed.
:::

The keys were generated in the subfolder of **NODE_DATA_PATH** under `/domains/domainID/keystore`. If you don't see the generated keypair in the subfolder, something went wrong. 

### Start the domain operator node

The domain operator node is running with an embedded consensus node, thus you need to specify the args for both the consensus node and the domain operator node:

```bash
subspace-node [consensus-chain-args] -- [domain-args]
```


:::note
Currently, the domain chain does not support syncing from other operator nodes; it needs to be deterministically derived from the consensus chain block by block.
:::

:::info
You need to **wipe** and sync your node from genesis block without using snap sync, since you need to sync both consensus and domain chains.
You do not need to wipe any existing plots. 
:::

:::tip
You can ignore setting up `your_operator_id` while you're syncing your node as you won't have an operator id until you have registered your operator. Make sure to set it after syncing and registration
by replacing `your_operator_id` with your operator_id obtained when registering the operator.

### Register an operator on domain

:::info
It's crucial to **fully sync** your node before registering as an operator. Please follow the commands in the ***Start the domain operator*** node section and only register as an operator once your node is fully synced. If many operators are registered but their nodes are still syncing or offline, it can adversely affect the speed of block production in the domain.
You are required to have at least 100 tAI3 in order to register your operator. You can obtain tAI3 by farming on the taurus network.
:::


#### Register an operator using Autonomys Staking interface

1. Proceed to the staking tab on [Astral](https://astral.autonomys.xyz/taurus/consensus) and make sure you have the Tarus network selected.

![NStaking-19](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-19.png)

2. Next, connect your wallet.

![NStaking-1](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-1.png)

3. Select the wallet you would like to connect. **SubWallet**, **NovaWallet**, and **Talisman** wallets are supported.

![NStaking-2](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-2.png)

4. Enter your password to give access to your wallet.

![NStaking-3](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-3.png)

5. Select the account you'd like to use from the dropdown menu. You can click the button in the upper left corner to see available and locked (staked) token balances for the selected account. 

![NStaking-4](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-4.png)

![NStaking-5](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-5.png)

6. While still on the `Staking` tab, select `Register Operator`.

![NStaking-6](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-6.png)

7. Select your Domain (It will default to Auto EVM), Signing key, Amount to Stake, Nominator Tax, a Minimum Nominator Stake, and then click on the `Register Operator` button at the bottom of the page.

:::info
Make sure to specify a Minimum Nominator Stake of at least 1 tAI3 and to use the operator key generated on the previous **[Create operator key](#create-operator-key)** step.
:::

8. Approve the request in the pop-up window.

![NStaking-9](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-9.png)

9. Congratulations, you're now registered as an **operator**!  While still on the `Staking` tab, select `Operators` and then Change the switch to say `My nominations` to see your operator and get the Operator Id.

![NStaking-10](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-10.png)

:::info
It can take up to 10 minutes for the operator to be registered and appear on the page.  It may take a day before your Stake amount is displayed under Total Stake in the table.  Once you have your Operator Id you can restart your operator node and include the `--operator-id **OPERATOR_ID**` as a parameter. 
:::

### Increasing and Decreasing Stake

To Increase your existing operator stake, you can click on the `Nominate` button next to your operator.
Choose an amount to stake and click on the `Nominate` button on the pop-up.
