## Download Subspace Node

Download `Subspace Node` for your respective operating system.

:::info Taurus Network Only
Currently, only running and registering an operator on the Taurus testnet is supported.

### Choosing the right domain

An operator needs to register on a specific domain and create a key pair to participate in bundle production. Autonomys is currently using `domain 0` for the EVM domain. 
More domains will be available in the future. It is possible to register an operator for each domain, but each operator will require running its own node. 
Currently operators can only be registered on the Taurus network.

:::tip
Any account with the **minimum operator stake of 100 tAI3** can become an operator. 
:::

### Create operator key

An operator needs a key pair to participate in bundle production.

To create a new operator key, run the following command:

:::tip Replace these placeholders
- `<BASE_PATH>`: Path to store node data
- `<DOMAIN_ID>`: Domain ID you want to operate on (e.g., 0 for EVM domain)
:::

```bash
./subspace-node-ubuntu-x86_64-skylake-taurus-2025-may-27 domain key create --base-path "<BASE_PATH>" --domain-id "<DOMAIN_ID>"
```

:::tip
The operator is responsible for finding out the correct domain ID they want to operate on.
:::

**You have successfully generated an operator key, congratulations!**

:::note
Be sure to record and securely store the printed seed phrase. If it is leaked or stolen, both your operator and nominator stakes could be at risk of being slashed.
:::

The keys were generated in the subfolder of `<BASE_PATH>/domains/<DOMAIN_ID>/keystore`. If you don't see the generated keypair in the subfolder, something went wrong. 

### Start the domain operator node

The domain operator node is running with an embedded consensus node, thus you need to specify the args for both the consensus node and the domain operator node:

```bash
subspace-node [consensus-chain-args] -- [domain-args]
```


:::note
Currently, the domain chain does not support syncing from other operator nodes; it needs to be deterministically derived from the consensus chain block by block.
:::

:::info
You need to **wipe** and sync your node from genesis block without using snap sync, since you need to sync both consensus and domain chains.
You do not need to wipe any existing farms. 
:::

:::tip
You can ignore setting up `<OPERATOR_ID>` while you're syncing your node as you won't have an operator id until you have registered your operator. Make sure to set it after syncing and registration by replacing `<OPERATOR_ID>` with your operator_id obtained when registering the operator.
:::

:::tip Replace these placeholders
- `<NAME>`: Your node name for telemetry
- `<BASE_PATH>`: Path to store node data
- `<DOMAIN_ID>`: Domain ID you want to operate on
- `<OPERATOR_ID>`: Your operator ID (obtained after registration)

### Register an operator on domain

:::info
It's crucial to **fully sync** your node before registering as an operator. Please follow the commands in the ***Start the domain operator*** node section and only register as an operator once your node is fully synced. If many operators are registered but their nodes are still syncing or offline, it can adversely affect the speed of block production in the domain.
You are required to have at least 100 tAI3 in order to register your operator. You can obtain tAI3 by farming on the taurus network.
:::


#### Register an operator using Autonomys Staking interface

1. Proceed to the staking tab on [Astral](https://astral.autonomys.xyz/taurus/consensus) and make sure you have the Tarus network selected.

![NStaking-19](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-19.png)

2. Next, connect your wallet.

![NStaking-1](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-1.png)

3. Select the wallet you would like to connect. **SubWallet**, **NovaWallet**, and **Talisman** wallets are supported.

![NStaking-2](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-2.png)

4. Enter your password to give access to your wallet.

![NStaking-3](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-3.png)

5. Select the account you'd like to use from the dropdown menu. You can click the button in the upper left corner to see available and locked (staked) token balances for the selected account. 

![NStaking-4](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-4.png)

![NStaking-5](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-5.png)

6. While still on the `Staking` tab, select `Register Operator`.

![NStaking-6](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-6.png)

7. Select your Domain (It will default to Auto EVM), Signing key, Amount to Stake, Nominator Tax, a Minimum Nominator Stake, and then click on the `Register Operator` button at the bottom of the page.

:::info
Make sure to specify a Minimum Nominator Stake of at least 1 tAI3 and to use the operator key generated on the previous **[Create operator key](#create-operator-key)** step.
:::

8. Approve the request in the pop-up window.

![NStaking-9](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-9.png)

9. Congratulations, you're now registered as an **operator**!  While still on the `Staking` tab, select `Operators` and then Change the switch to say `My nominations` to see your operator and get the Operator Id.

![NStaking-10](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-10.png)

:::info
It will take until the end of **[an epoch](#staking-epoch)** for the operator to be registered and appear on the page. Once you have your Operator Id you can restart your operator node and include the `--operator-id **OPERATOR_ID**` as a parameter. 
:::

### Increasing Stake

1. To Increase your existing operator stake, you can click on the `Nominate` button next to your operator either from the `Operators` page or the `My Nominations` page.

2. Choose an amount to stake and click on the `Nominate` button on the pop-up.

![NStaking-11](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-8.png)

3. After approving the transaction, you will then see a pending transaction under your operator that should be completed at the end of **[an epoch](#staking-epoch)**

![NStaking-12](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-21.png)

### Decreasing Stake

1. To decrease your existing operator stake, you can click on the `Withdraw` button next to your operator on the `My Nominations` page.

![NStaking-13](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-22.png)

2. Use the slider to determine what percentage of your stake you wish to withdraw.

![NStaking-14](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-20.png)

3. Click on the `Withdraw` button to confirm the withdrawal and approve the transaction.

4. You will then see a pending transaction for the withdrawal.

![NStaking-15](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-23.png)

Your funds will be automatically withdrawn after 14,400 domain blocks  (can be from 1-2 days depending on block production speed).

5. After the withdraw is complete, you will want to click on the `Unlock Funds` button.

![NStaking-16](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-24.png)

6. Next confirm the unlock in the pop-up by pressing the Unlock Funds button. Your funds should now by unlocked and available for use.

![NStaking-17](/img/doc-imgs/operators-staking/NStaking-25.png)

## Staking Epoch

A staking epoch is a period of time during which staking distribution remains the same. This period is currently set to 100 blocks (~10 minutes). The end of each epoch triggers a series of events to transition to the next epoch. 
These events include:

- allocation of fees earned for the blocks confirmed during the epoch

- deposits and withdrawals of stake

- operator registrations and de-registrations

- recalculation of stake distribution for the slot leader election
