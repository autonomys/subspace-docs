      "description": "To earn block and vote rewards and build a TSSC balance on our incentivized testnet you will need to run a farmer which connects to a node. The easiest way to acheive this is by using Space Acres while the Advanced CLI is a little trickier to setup but gives you most control over configuration. We recommend you get started with Space Acres while you learn the ropes and make a more informed decision later."
