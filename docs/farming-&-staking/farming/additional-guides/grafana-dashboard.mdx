# Grafana Dashboard

## Prerequisites

First install [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) on your machine.

:::note
You can also use [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/) instead of installing it locally.
:::

## Enable metrics

To enable metrics, you'll have to modify the CLI arguments of your node and farmer by adding the Prometheus option:

for a node:
`--prometheus-listen-on 127.0.0.1:9080`

for a farmer:
`--prometheus-listen-on 127.0.0.1:9081`

To apply the changes, it's necessary to restart your node and farmer. You should then have the capability to reach the metrics at `http://localhost:9080/metrics` and `http://localhost:9081/metrics`.

## Configure Prometheus targets

Locate the `prometheus.yml` file and add the following job entry under the `scrape_configs` section:
```
- job_name: "subspace"
  static_configs:
    - targets: ["localhost:9080"]
      labels:
        group: 'node'
    - targets: ["localhost:9081"]
      labels:
        group: 'farmer'
```
On Linux machines, you can typically find the `prometheus.yml` file at the following path: `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`

Restart Prometheus with the new configuration.

:::note
Prometheus can reload its configuration without restarting by using the SIGHUP signal. If you're running on Linux this can be performed by using `kill -s SIGHUP <PID>`, replacing `<PID>` with your Prometheus process ID.
:::

## Configure Grafana

By default, Grafana usually runs on port 3000. You can access Grafana by navigating to the following URL: `http://localhost:3000`.

The default username and password is `admin`.

Add your Prometheus Data Source:

Click `Save & test` to test the configuration, if everything is alright you'll see the green message "Data source is working".

## Import Grafana dashboard

Copy and paste the [Grafana Dashboard ID](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/20433) `20433` and click `Load` to complete importing:

Select your `Prometheus` as Data Source and click `Import`.

At this point, you should be able to monitor your node.
