## Bridging Tokens on the Autonomys Network

This guide explains how to bridge tokens between Auto EVM and other networks.

:::tip
In this example we will be bridging back and forth between Auto EVM and Ethereum, but BNB Chain is also supported.
:::

### Connecting a wallet to the Bridge

1. Navigate to the [Bridge Site](https://bridge.mainnet.autonomys.xyz/).

2. Clicking `Advanced` next to the gear icon and then the up arrow once on the Max base fee usually adds enough gas to complete the transaction. Click on the `Save these values` checkbox if you want to avoid this step in the future. Click `Save`.

## Adding WAI3 on Ethereum to Metamask

1. To view your bridged AI3 on Ethereum you will need to add the token to Metamask. The Ethereum WAI3 contract can be found at [0x363FCa95F23E10C76ef793D62d92d39e89d83AC1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x363FCa95F23E10C76ef793D62d92d39e89d83AC1) which will need importing.

2. First, switch network in Metamask to Ethereum.
