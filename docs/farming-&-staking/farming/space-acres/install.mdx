## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:

1. A computer with a reliable internet connection.
2. Enough free disk space (we'll help you determine how much later).
3. Administrator access to your computer.

What to expect: 

- Sync might take from a few hours to up to a day.
- The initial syncing and plotting process requires substantial computational resources, so you may notice that your computer runs slower for day-to-day tasks until syncing and plotting are complete.

:::note
Please note that a wallet with a Substrate address is required to run the software.<br />
To learn how to create a Substrate wallet, please visit our pages on [SubWallet (recommended)](/wallets/subwallet) or [**`{polkadot.js}`** extension](/wallets/polkadot).
:::

:::caution Port Forwarding
To ensure proper communication between Space Acres and other peers, you need to forward ports 30333 and 30433 from your router to the PC running Space Acres. For more details, refer to the [Port Forwarding Guide](https://docs.autonomys.xyz/farming/guides/port-config#ports-to-forward--firewall-access).

## Step 2: Set Up Space Acres

Now comes the exciting part—setting up your farm! Here's what you'll see on the first screen:

   <ThemedImage
   alt="Space Acres Configuration"
   sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('img/doc-imgs/space-acres/space-acres-setup-1-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('img/doc-imgs/space-acres/space-acres-setup-1-dark.png'),
   }}
   /> 


1. **Node path**:
   - This is where Space Acres will store important data.
   - Pick a location with plenty of free space; it might be as simple as **/Documents**.

2. **Rewards address**:
   - This is where your farming rewards will be sent.
   - It starts with **su** for **SubWallet** and with **5** for `{Polkadot.js}` extension.
   - If you don't have one, click **Create wallet** to create a wallet.

3. **Path to Farm 0 and its size**:
   - This is where your **plots** (farming data) will be stored.
   - The size determines your probability of getting a reward on the Network. In most cases, larger plots (or larger farm size) will gain you more rewards.
   - The size could be set as a fixed size, e.g. 4TB, or 500GB, or as a percentage value of the available disk space.
   - If you prefer to have a few farms (e.g. you have some spare space on different SSD drives), you can click on **Add farm** to pledge some additional storage space.

   <ThemedImage
   alt="Configured setup screen"
   sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('img/doc-imgs/space-acres/space-acres-setup-2-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('img/doc-imgs/space-acres/space-acres-setup-2-dark.png'),
   }}
   />

   :::tip
   The screen above is just an example of configured setup screen, make sure to use your own **Node path**, **Rewards address*, **Path to farm 0 and its size**, and **Fixed size / Disk space percentage** values
   :::

4. **Advanced configuration (optional)**:
   - Toggle **Reduce plotting CPU load** (select this option if you're using the same PC for other tasks)
   - Modify the default values for blockchain and DSN P2P ports
   - Toggle **Faster Networking** (selecting this option may increase the load on your router)


   :::tip
   Don't worry about this unless you're an experienced user.
   :::

   For a comprehensive list of prerequisites and explanations, refer to our [Getting Started Guide](/farming/intro). 


   :::info
   Your screen may look slightly different depending on your operating system, but the basic information required will be the same.
   :::

## Step 3: Start Farming

   1. After entering your information, click **Start**.
   2. Space Acres will now set up your node and connect to the Autonomys Network.
   3. You'll see progress bars as it syncs data and creates your farm plots.

   <ThemedImage
   alt="Initialization"
   sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('img/doc-imgs/space-acres/space-acres-setup-3-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('img/doc-imgs/space-acres/space-acres-setup-3-dark.png'),
   }}
   />

4. Once everything is ready, you'll see the main Space Acres dashboard where you can monitor your farming activity.

   <ThemedImage
   alt="Space Acres Dashboard"
   sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('img/doc-imgs/space-acres/space-acres-setup-4-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('img/doc-imgs/space-acres/space-acres-setup-4-dark.png'),
   }}
   />

5. Initial syncing and plotting can take from a few hours to days, depending on your hardware, network speed, and specified farm size. Below are examples of the various stages you can expect.

   a. **Cache Syncing**

   <ThemedImage
   alt="Space Acres Dashboard"
   sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('img/doc-imgs/space-acres/space-acres-setup-5-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('img/doc-imgs/space-acres/space-acres-setup-5-dark.png'),
   }}
   />

   b. **Initial Plotting**

   <ThemedImage
   alt="Space Acres Dashboard"
   sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('img/doc-imgs/space-acres/space-acres-setup-6-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('img/doc-imgs/space-acres/space-acres-setup-6-dark.png'),
   }}
   />

   c. **Plotting Complete, Now Farming**

   <ThemedImage
   alt="Space Acres Dashboard"
   sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('img/doc-imgs/space-acres/space-acres-setup-7-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('img/doc-imgs/space-acres/space-acres-setup-7-dark.png'),
   }}
   />

6. Once syncing and plotting are complete, you'll notice a drop in CPU and RAM usage, and the dashboard will display your earned rewards and the estimated time until the next reward.

   <ThemedImage
   alt="Space Acres Dashboard"
   sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('img/doc-imgs/space-acres/space-acres-setup-8-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('img/doc-imgs/space-acres/space-acres-setup-8-dark.png'),
   }}
   />

   :::tip
   You can toggle the dashboard to view brief statistics or display all plotted sectors along with their status. The color codes of sectors are explained below. By hovering over the icons on the right, you can check the number of missed challenges, your average auditing and proving performance, and other useful stats.
   :::

### Happy farming!

## Understanding Your Farm

Your farm is made up of **sectors** that change color based on their status. For your convenience, we've provided a table detailing the color codes associated with different sector statuses. This will enhance your insight into the activities and conditions of your plot.

| Status            | Color Preview | Description                                                  |
