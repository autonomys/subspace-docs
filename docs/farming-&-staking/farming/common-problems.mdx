This page documents known errors and warnings you may encounter while running Autonomys software. Each issue includes its severity level, explanation, and resolution steps to help you quickly identify and fix problems.

## Quick Navigation

- **[Severity Levels](#severity-levels)** - Understanding error severity indicators
- **[Program Issues](#program-issues)** - Errors and warnings tied to specific components (Node, Farmer, Farming Cluster)
- **[Unexpected Behavior](#unexpected-behavior)** - General issues not tied to specific components

We regularly update this guide based on community feedback and new releases.

## Program Issues

These errors and warnings are tied to specific components. In this section, we highlight known issues, offer available remediation steps, and specify their severity levels.

## Unexpected Behavior

These unexpected behaviors are not linked to specific components. In this section, we outline common issues and provide available remediation steps.

    title="No Output and Missing Error Codes (Windows)" 
    slug="no-output-windows"
  >
    <ContentText>
      If you encounter a situation in Windows where the node produces no output and does not display any error code, it is likely that you simply need to install the latest version of the <Link to="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist">Visual C++ Redistributable package</Link>.

  <ContentBlock 
    title="Farmer stuck on plotting" 
    slug="stuck-plotting"
  >
    <ContentText>
      Try restarting your node or farmer. We've observed that when creating larger farms, the process may sometimes seem stalled, but it typically resumes automatically after a while.
