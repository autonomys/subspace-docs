### View your Logs

A good place to start if you are facing trouble is by viewing your logs and seeing if there are any errors or insights that might be available. You can find the location for your logs below:

- **🖼️ Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local/pulsar/logs`
- **🍎 macOS:** `$HOME/Library/Logs/pulsar/`
- **🐧 Ubuntu:** `$HOME/.local/share/pulsar/logs`


### Enable Rust Backtrace 

When running the Subspace Network Farmer & Node, sometimes you may encounter an error message that includes a line similar to the following:

```text
Backtrace omitted. Run with RUST_BACKTRACE=1 environment variable to display it.
```

This error message means that Rust (the programming language that Subspace Network Farmer & Node is written in) has encountered a problem and has provided a diagnostic backtrace that can help diagnose the issue. However, by default, the backtrace is not displayed. To see the backtrace, you need to enable the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable.

To enable the `RUST_BACKTRACE` enter the following into your terminal:

- **🖼️ Windows**(PowerShell): `$Env:RUST_BACKTRACE=1`
- **🍎 macOS**: `export RUST_BACKTRACE=1`
- **🐧 Ubuntu**: `export RUST_BACKTRACE=1`

Once you have enabled the RUST_BACKTRACE simply rerun the application and you will get additional info upon any errors.
