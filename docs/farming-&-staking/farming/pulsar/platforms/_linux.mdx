### Linux Filesystem Recommendations
:::note Important Notices for Linux Users
- **SWAP**:  A swap is necessary only if your system has a low amount of RAM.

- **RAID**:  Avoid redundancy setups (RAID1/5/6, RAIDZ) for filesystems with plots. The subspace farmer uses checksums for data integrity and can often recover corrupted blocks. Use `scrub` for maintenance.  RAID0 accomplishes little more than to put more of your plots at risk in case of a drive failure.

- **ext4**:  The recommended formatting command for drives dedicated solely to subspace is `sudo mkfs.ext4 -m 0 -T largefile4 /path/to/dev`, as it maximizes usable space and the plot resizing functionality operates flawlessly.  Previously recommended striping and chunk size parameters have not demonstrated any appreciable benefit or harm.

- **XFS**:  No longer recommended as attempting to resize the plot (larger or smaller) with the drive nearly full (98%+) will render the plot unfarmable unless sufficient extra space can be freed up by means other than trying to shrink the plot (try deleting piece_cache.bin if this happens to you).  Full XFS disk utilization can only be achieved during the plot's initial creation, and will still yield less usable space than the ext4 recommendation above.

- **CoW Filesystems**: Avoid using Copy-on-Write (CoW) file systems (like ReFS, BTRFS, ZFS, bcachefs, HAMMER) with Subspace. If using BTRFS, disable CoW using `sudo chattr +C path/to/data/dir` before starting Subspace. This applies only to newly created files. Alternatively, use a non-CoW filesystem like ext4 as recommended above.

:::caution System Adjustments
- **File Descriptor Limit**: Linux has a hard limit of 100k file descriptors. Exceeding this may cause errors. Substrate has a default limit of 10k. Check and adjust the limit at `/proc/sys/fs/file-max`. Refer to this [tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/increase-number-of-maximum-open-files-in-linux) for changing the limit.

- **Dependencies**: If you encounter an error related to `libgomp.so.1`, install the `libgomp1` library with `sudo apt-get install libgomp1`.

## Step 2: Initialize Pulsar
---
We will now initialize Pulsar. This is where we will configure Reward Address, Plot Size, Plot Location, etc. 

1. Open Terminal, type `cd Downloads` (or `cd Your-File-Location`).
2. Make the binary executable by running:
    - `chmod +x [pulsary-binary-filename-here]`
3. Execute the `init` command as seen below.
```shell-session
./pulsar-ubuntu-x86_64-skylake-v0.7.4-alpha  init
```

4. This will prompt you to setup your Pulsar configurations to begin farming. You should see a similar prompt like so:

```bash
Configuration creation process has started...
Do you have an existing farmer/reward address? [y/n]: y
Enter your farmer/reward address: REDACTED_ADDRESS
Enter your node name to be identified on the network (defaults to `username`, press enter to use the default):
Specify a path for storing plot files (press enter to use the default: `"/home/username/.local/share/pulsar/farms"`):
Specify a path for storing node files (press enter to use the default: `"/home/username/.local/share/pulsar/node"`):
Specify a plot size (defaults to `2.0 GB`, press enter to use the default):
Specify the chain to farm. Available options are: [Gemini3g, Dev, DevNet].
Defaults to `Gemini3g`, press enter to use the default:
Configuration has been generated at /home/username/.config/pulsar
Ready for lift off! Run the follow command to begin: `"path/to/executable" farm`
```
5. Once complete, the settings will be written to the `settings.toml`. You can find Your `settings.toml` in `$HOME/.config/pulsar/settings.toml`

## Step 3. Start Farming with Pulsar
---

We will now start the farmer with the `farm` command

1. Run the following command below to start farming with Pulsar.
```shell-session
./pulsar-ubuntu-x86_64-skylake-v0.7.4-alpha farm
```

2. You should see the farmer and node start successfully and begin syncing, plotting, and then farming:

```text
Starting node ... (this might take up to couple of minutes)
Node started successfully!
Starting farmer ...
Farmer started successfully!
Initial plotting for plot: #0 (/home/username/.local/share/pulsar/farms)
⠁ [00:00:00] 3% [=>                                      ]
      (31.00 MiB/953.67 MiB) 157.35 GiB/s, plotting, ETA: 0s
```

3. That's it! Enjoy and Happy Farming!
