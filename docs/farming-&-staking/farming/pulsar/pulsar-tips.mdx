## Additional Tips

:::caution

The Pulsar application is experiencing functional issues when used in conjunction with Gemini 3g. We strongly advise users to switch to the [Advanced CLI](../advanced-cli/cli-prerequisites) method for effective farming on the Subspace Network during this period. Our team is diligently working to resolve these compatibility problems and restore full functionality to Pulsar at the earliest opportunity.

### Switching to a new release

:::info
Unless specifically mentioned by the Development team you should **NOT** have to wipe your node and configuration on new releases.
:::

In general you should be able to download the latest release of **Pulsar**, and re-start with the same commands as you started to prior version with no errors.

There are rare cases where version updates will cause issues with **Pulsar** and you may have to use the `./pulsar_release wipe` command, typically when errors occur. 
If you have any issues you can always check our [Forums](https://forums.subspace.network) and hop in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/subspace-network) server to ask for help.

### Wipe Node & Farmer

:::tip Updated from a previous version and now having issues?

Occasionally after updating to a new version of Pulsar you will need to wipe your node and farmer, generally this should not be required but it can be attempted if your farmer is having issues after having been working fine previously. Particularly if there is suspected data corruption e.g. after a power outage.

:::

To simply restart the node, go to the terminal where you started the `farm` command, and press `Ctrl + C` you should see a shutdown message appear and the application will attempt a simple shutdown, if you dont see the message press `Ctrl + C` again to force shutdown. You can then simply start the farmer again with the `farm` command you used prior.

Use the same file name as the previous init and farm steps, then add the wipe command to free the previous storage that was being used. Generally, only do this if you have severe errors and are prompted by a staff member.

```bash
./pulsar-file-name wipe
```

After wiping, follow the [get started with Pulsar](pulsar-install) section to start farming again!


### Telemetry & Block Explorer

Explore the Subspace Network in depth with our variety of telemetry tools and block explorers. Whether you're monitoring network activity or exploring blockchain data, these resources provide comprehensive insights into the network's performance and transactions.

- **[Telemetry Server](https://telemetry.subspace.network/)**: Get real-time insights into network activity and performance metrics. Ideal for monitoring the overall health and status of the Subspace Network.

- **[Official Block Explorer](https://explorer.subspace.network/)**: Our primary tool for viewing blocks, transactions, and network activity on the Subspace Network. This explorer offers an intuitive interface and detailed information.

- **[Subscan Block Explorer](https://subspace.subscan.io/)**: An alternative block explorer providing detailed views of blocks, transactions, and network events. Subscan is known for its user-friendly interface and additional data analytics features.

- **[Polkadot.js Block Explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc-1.gemini-3g.subspace.network%2Fws#/accounts)**: For users familiar with the Polkadot ecosystem, this explorer offers a seamless experience for exploring the Subspace Network using the Polkadot.js interface.

### Specify Version

The `settings.toml` file contains critical configurations for Pulsar, including the network your node connects to. Specify your network environment by setting the `chain` variable under the `[node]` section:

```toml
# settings.toml
[node]
chain = 'gemini-3g' //In this Example we have set to Gemini-3g
# ... additional configuration settings ...
```

Set the `chain` value to your target network identifier.
- Local Development: Set to `dev`
- Gemini Testnet: Set to `gemini-3g`

If you want to learn more about Tmux and its options check out their Repo [here](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
:::

**Create a new tmux session using a socket file named farming**.

```shell-session
$ tmux -S farming
```

**Move process to background by detaching**.
```text
Ctrl+b d OR ⌘+b d (Mac)
```

**To re-attach**.

```shell-session
$ tmux -S farming attach
```

Alternatively, you can use the following single command to both create (if not exists already) and attach to a session:

```shell-session
$ tmux new-session -A -D -s farming
```

To delete farming session:
```shell-session
$ tmux kill-session -t farming
```
