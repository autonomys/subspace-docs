:::tip Installation Videos

For those who prefer a visual guide, we have prepared installation videos to assist you. The videos will help you to set up the Space Acres <Badge variant="recommended" text="Recommended" /> farming application in under 10 minutes. Please follow [the installation videos](/farming/space-acres/install#installation-videos) to use SubWallet to create a compatible Substrate account and refer to the detailed guide on downloading and configuring Autonomys' farming application, Space Acres.

## Hardware

<a id="min-hardware"></a>
<a id="min-node-storage"></a>
<a id="farm-storage"></a>

| Hardware | CPU | RAM | Node Storage | Farm Storage |
| --- | --- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Minimum [¹](https://docs.autonomys.xyz/farming/intro#min-hardware) | 4 Cores+ | 8GB | 100GiB [²](https://docs.autonomys.xyz/farming/intro#min-node-storage) | 100GiB |
| Recommended | Intel Core i7-6700 or equivalent | 16GB+ | 256GB | <Icon icon={ICONS.INFINITY} /> [³](https://docs.autonomys.xyz/farming/intro#farm-storage) |

<small>¹ Nodes that meet minimum requirements should be able to farm and sync with the network under normal conditions. However, performance may decline during periods of heavy network load, such as when blocks are filled with numerous transactions.</small>
<br />
<p>
<small>² While 100GiB is sufficient for running a farming node, a domain node will require more than 100GiB of storage.</small>
<br />
<small>³ Storage contribution impacts block and vote rewards on the Autonomys Network. More farmed sectors will lead to faster and more frequent rewards. You can start with as little as 100GiB, but allocating more will maximize your reward potential.</small>
<br />
</p>

:::warning Internet Considerations

Operating a node and farmer can be data intensive. It is advisable to have a stable and unlimited internet connection.

:::

### Reference Hardware

Our benchmarking tests were performed using the Intel Core i7-6700 CPU. We calibrated the transaction weights to ensure that a full block does not contain more transactions than this CPU can handle within the 2-second block execution time limit. This guarantees that nodes with hardware equivalent to or better than the Intel Core i7-6700 can process blocks at full capacity without performance issues.

While farmers using hardware below this specification may function effectively under most conditions, they could face challenges during peak network activity. If blocks consistently fill with transactions, nodes with lower specifications might struggle to keep pace, which could impact farming performance and rewards.

You can see detailed machine information used for the [reference hardware](https://gist.github.com/DaMandal0rian/21a01da49ee820c3e59bce7f8c2d0166).

## Storage

:::caution Hard Drives Not Supported

Hard disk drives are not supported. The use of smart caching, tiered storage, RAID, or other acceleration methods will not be effective due to the significant random read IOPS required for the proving process.

:::

SSD storage is required. High end models are not necessary and a mid range SSD from a reputable manufacturer with adequate endurance should be sufficient. Be cautious with lesser known brands as they may face issues with maintaining consistent read performance. You can also use NVMe SSDs but this is not required.



## File Systems (Linux)

:::caution File Descriptor Limit

Linux systems may have a default file descriptor limit, which can vary based on distribution. Exceeding this limit could cause errors. For detailed information, visit our [Tips & Tricks](/farming/cli/tips#changing-number-of-open-files-limit-linux) guide.

:::

<Tabs queryString="file-system">

<TabItem value="ext4" label={<TabLabel icon={ICONS.CHECK_CIRCLE}>ext4</TabLabel>} default>
This file system maximizes usable space for the farmer.
```bash title="Recommended Formatting Command for Drives Dedicated to Subspace Farms:"
sudo mkfs.ext4 -m 0 -T largefile4 -C 16384 -O bigalloc /dev/sdX
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="xfs" label={<TabLabel icon={ICONS.CLOSE_CIRCLE}>XFS</TabLabel>}>
Resizing a farm when the drive is nearly full (98% or more) will render the farm unfarmable unless sufficient additional space is freed up through other means. Full disk utilization can only be achieved during the farm's initial creation and will yield less usable space compared to ext4.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cow" label={<TabLabel icon={ICONS.CLOSE_CIRCLE}>CoW</TabLabel>}>
Copy-on-Write file systems (ReFS, BTRFS, ZFS, bcachefs, HAMMER) are not recommended due to increased latency and reduced write speeds associated with managing unnecessary data copies.
```bash title="Disable CoW on BTRFS:"
sudo chattr +C /path/to/farm
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="raid" label={<TabLabel icon={ICONS.CLOSE_CIRCLE}>RAID</TabLabel>}>
The farmer employs checksums for data integrity and can recover from corrupted blocks. Striping provides no benefits and increases the risk of requiring replotting across multiple drives instead of just one.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="swap" label={<TabLabel icon={ICONS.CLOSE_CIRCLE}>SWAP</TabLabel>}>
Only necessary if your system has limited RAM.
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Dependencies

:::caution Windows No Output Bug
If you face an error where the node outputs nothing and no error code is given it is likely you just need to install the latest Visual C++ Redistributable package [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)

## Networking

:::info Port Forwarding & Firewall Guide

For detailed information on network configurations, including port forwarding requirements and firewall settings, please refer to our [Port Forwarding & Firewall](/farming/guides/port-config) guide.

:::

## Security Considerations

:::info Safety and Security Guide

For detailed information, visit our [Safety and Security](/learn/security) guide.

:::

Ensure your system is regularly updated, configure [port forwarding](/farming/guides/port-config#ports-to-forward--firewall-access), set up your [firewall](/farming/guides/port-config#firewall-configuration), and follow best practices for network safety. For comprehensive security guidelines, please refer to our [Safety and Security](/learn/security) guide.

## Wallet

:::info Wallets Guide

For detailed information, visit our [SubWallet](/wallets/subwallet) or [Polkadot.JS](/wallets/polkadot) guide.


:::

Before you begin, make sure you have a wallet to receive rewards. We recommend using [SubWallet](https://subwallet.app), but [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/extension) is also available. Install one of these wallets as a browser extension and create a new account. Your account address will be required during the setup process.
