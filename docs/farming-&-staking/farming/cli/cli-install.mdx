## CLI Installation Guide

:::tip Substrate Address Needed

To use this software, you need a Substrate wallet address. For assistance in creating a Substrate wallet, refer to our guides for ✨ [SubWallet](/wallets/subwallet) or [Polkadot.js](/wallets/polkadot).

If you have a previous wallet address that starts with `st`, you can still use it, or you can transform it to the new `su` prefix. You can convert your existing wallet address using the tool available at [ss58.org](https://ss58.org). Previously, our testnets used the prefix `2254`, while the Taurus testnet and Autonomys mainnet use the prefix `6094`.

:::

We’ll provide the files you need for your operating system:
- **subspace-node**: The node implementation for the Subspace protocol.
- **subspace-farmer**: Manages plotting, replotting, and farming rewards.
