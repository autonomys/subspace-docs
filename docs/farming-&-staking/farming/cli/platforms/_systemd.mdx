Create a New User for Autonomys:

:::warning Security risks
Running a node as a root user carries significant risks for the system. 
It is recommended to create a separate user for this purpose.
:::

```bash
sudo useradd -m -p ! -s /sbin/nologin -c "" subspace
```

You can also use an existing user, but having a separate user enhances the security of your server.

Switch to the Newly Created User:
```bash
sudo su subspace -s /bin/bash
```

Create a Directory for Executable Files:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
```

Download the Executable Files, using the appropriate commands:

By default, these commands download the executable files to the `~/.local/bin` directory. 
You can change the directory by modifying the respective string.

You can use the same commands to update the node.

Make the Files Executable:
```bash
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/subspace-node
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/subspace-farmer
```

Create a Directory for Node and Farmer Data:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share
```

Exit from the User:
```bash
exit
```

---

Generate Contents for the Service Files, replacing the relevant fields. 
Remember to change the username if setting up the node from a regular user:

<AdvancedSystemdServiceFileGenerator />

Open the Node Service File and Paste the Corresponding Generated Content:
```bash
EDITOR=nano sudo -e /etc/systemd/system/subspace-node.service
```

Open the Farmer Service File and Paste the Corresponding Generated Content:
```bash
EDITOR=nano sudo -e /etc/systemd/system/subspace-farmer.service
```

Enable and Start the Node and Farmer:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now subspace-{node,farmer}
```

---

### Useful Commands

Start Node:
```bash
sudo systemctl start subspace-node
```

Start Farmer:
```bash
sudo systemctl start subspace-farmer
```

Stop Node:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop subspace-node
```

Stop Farmer:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop subspace-farmer
```

Enable Node (for automatic startup on system boot):
```bash
sudo systemctl enable subspace-node
```

Enable Farmer (for automatic startup on system boot):
```bash
sudo systemctl enable subspace-farmer
```

Disable Node (to prevent automatic startup on system boot):
```bash
sudo systemctl disable subspace-node
```

Disable Farmer (to prevent automatic startup on system boot):
```bash
sudo systemctl disable subspace-farmer
```

Check Node Service Status:
```bash
sudo systemctl status subspace-node
```

Check Farmer Service Status:
```bash
sudo systemctl status subspace-farmer
```

View Node Logs:
```bash
sudo journalctl -f -o cat -u subspace-node
```

View Farmer Logs:
```bash
sudo journalctl -f -o cat -u subspace-farmer
```

Count Farmer Rewards Received in the Last Hour:
```bash
sudo journalctl -o cat -u subspace-farmer --since="1 hour ago" | grep -i "Successfully signed reward hash" | wc -l
```

### Upgrade

To upgrade a node and farmer, first, stop running services:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop subspace-{node,farmer}
```

After using the commands from the beginning of the manual, download the executable files of the new release.
And if you installed under a regular user, you will need to switch to that user beforehand.

Now you can start the services:
```bash
sudo systemctl start subspace-{node,farmer}
```
