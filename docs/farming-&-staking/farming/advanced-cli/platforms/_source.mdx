### Build from source (Linux)

If you're running unsupported Linux distribution or CPU architecture, you may try to build binaries yourself from source.

NOTE: This is primarily targeted at tech-savvy users and not recommended unless you know what you're doing.
Please try to find answer to your question online before reaching out to maintainers.

You'll have to have [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) installed as well as LLVM, Clang and CMake in addition to usual developer tooling (Ubuntu example):
```text
sudo apt-get install llvm clang cmake
```

:::warning LLVM + Clang 16
The build with LLVM + Clang 16 ends with `UnknownOpcode(192)` error due to breaking changes concerning WASM in LLVM 16. You can read more about this issue [here](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/13636). At this point, the solution is to use LLVM + Clang 15 and add the `-Z build-std` flag to the `cargo build` command. 
:::

Now clone the source and build snapshot `snapshot-2023-aug-18` (replace occurrences with the snapshot you want to build):
```shell-session
git clone https://github.com/subspace/subspace.git
cd subspace
git checkout snapshot-2023-aug-18
cargo build \
    --profile production \
    --bin subspace-node \
    --bin subspace-farmer
```

You'll find two binaries under `target/production` directory once it succeeds, after which refer to instructions above on how to use them.
