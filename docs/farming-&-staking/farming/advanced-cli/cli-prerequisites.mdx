### System Requirements

:::danger Farming can be Network Intensive.

Make sure you have a stable network connection. During the plotting phase of farming, it can be network intensive.

This may impact your network usage so please check your network connection if you have a hard data limit.

### Security Considerations

For a secure farming setup, ensure your system is updated, use a secure wallet, configure firewalls properly, and follow network safety protocols. Detailed security practices are available on our [Security Best Practices page](../../../learn/security).

### Crypto Wallet

Before running anything you need to have a wallet where you'll receive testnet coins. There are currently two wallets we suggest using, SubWallet being the preferred route.
- [SubWallet](https://subwallet.app/)
- [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/)

Install one of the two wallets above into your browser and create a new account there.
The address of your account will be necessary at the last step.

For help refer to our forum post [How to setup Subwallet & a Polkadot.js Wallet](https://forum.subspace.network/t/subspace-wallet/61)
- *make sure to follow the Bonus section of the bottom of the post above.*


### Required Ports

For the smooth operation of our blockchain node, specific ports must be open to handle incoming connections. These ports are essential for various functions within our network.

#### Ports to Open

Ensure the following **TCP** and **UDP** ports are open for incoming connections:

1. **30333 (Blockchain Network Port):** This is the primary port for blockchain network communication. It's essential for the node to connect and interact with the blockchain network.

2. **30433 (DSN Listener Port):** This port is used by the node to listen to the Decentralized Storage Network (DSN). It's crucial for data storage and retrieval operations within the blockchain ecosystem.

3. **30533 (Farmer Listener Port):** This port is designated for the farmer to listen to the DSN. It plays a key role in managing and operating the decentralized farming activities on the network.

#### Special Note on Port 9944

- **9944 (RPC Port):** This port is used for Remote Procedure Call (RPC) between the node and the farmer. It's important to note that port 9944 does **not** require forwarding if the node and farmer are on the same local network, as they communicate internally.

#### Configuring Your Network

- **Router Configuration (Desktop):** If you're using a router, you'll need to forward the specified TCP and UDP ports to the machine running your node. The process varies across different router models. Please refer to our [How to Forward Ports](../Additional-Guides/port-forwarding) guide for a detailed tutorial.

- **No Firewall Scenario:** If your server operates without a firewall, no additional configuration is needed.

- **With Firewall:** Ensure that the above-mentioned TCP and UDP ports are open in your firewall settings.

- **Direct Connection:** If your computer is connected directly to the internet (without a router), no further action is required.

By correctly configuring these ports, you ensure reliable and secure communication within our blockchain network.


### Storage

**HDDs are not supported and will never be.** We don't recommended trying to use smart caching, tiered storage or other ways to accelerate it, you'll be 100% disappointed and just waste your time.

**The node will require 100 GiB of good quality SSD**. Doesn't have to be anything amazing, but something mid-range from a reputable manufacturer with decent endurance is recommended.

**The farmer side can work with pretty much any SSD whatsoever that is not fake and not outright broken**, dedicating high quality high endurance SSD is pointless unless you already have it for reasons unrelated to Subspace. Software writes to disk in near-perfect for SSD way, effectively doing write leveling if SSD is solely dedicated to farming.

**RAID of any kind is pointless and can only harm performance and/or rewards.** RAID0 will most likely make things slower rather than faster (application benefits from knowing underlying hardware topology). RAID1 or any other redundancy level is 100% pointless too since farms are stateless and can be removed if a disk breaks without losing data on other disks, it'll just make thing slower and reduce the effective capacity that can be used for farming, *reducing farming rewards for literally no benefit in exchange*.

### File System

You can use any file system with default settings, we advise against their use for Subspace but in the case of CoW file systems like **ZFS** or **BTRFS** you need to disable **CoW** for the farmer directory, or adjust the **recordsize**.

In order to disable **CoW** on **BTRFS**, run the command `chattr +C /your_farmer_directory/`.

In case of **ZFS**, you can try adjusting the **recordsize** by running `zfs set recordsize=128K tank/dataset`, or creating a separate **dataset** for the farmer with adjusted **recordsize** parameters.
