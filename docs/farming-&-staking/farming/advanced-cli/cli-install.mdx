:::tip 
[Releases](https://github.com/autonomys/subspace/releases) section on our GitHub is the best place to get fresh releases of binaries and check out the source code.
:::

:::caution Multiple Versions

There are multiple versions of our releases available below. 
 **Skylake:** For Intel Skylake onwards and AMD Ryzen CPUs. Typically those PCs manufactured after 2015.
 **Legacy (x86-64-v2):** For Intel Broadwell, Haswell and older CPUs, as well as AMD's equivalents. Designed for the CPU  architecture generally found in systems produced between 2009 and 2015. Also supports VM environments that do not expose the Skylake onwards instructions.

## Get Started with Advanced CLI Installation

We will download two files for your respective operating system.
1. `Subspace-Node` - This is the executable that actually makes the connection with the Autononys network
2. `Subspace-Farmer` - This is the executable that will actually farm for rewards on your allocated storage plots.

:::note
Starting with the February 19th release, we've **enhanced plotting performance** by increasing internal concurrency. This enhancement leads to improved CPU utilization and increased RAM usage. If you prefer to revert your farmer to its previous behavior, you can use the flag `--record-encoding-concurrency 1`.
