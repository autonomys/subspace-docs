## Additional Tips

Welcome to the Additional Tips section! Whether you're a seasoned farmer or just starting out with the Subspace Network, these tips and tricks are designed to enhance your experience and efficiency. Here, we delve into practical advice and lesser-known techniques to help you fine-tune your farming setup and navigate common challenges with ease. From configuring your environment to managing background processes, these insights are tailored to ensure your Farmer operates smoothly and effectively. Let's dive in and explore how you can get the most out of your Subspace Network Farmer.

### Benchmarking Your Farmer
Benchmarking helps you test the plotting speed of your farmer against different versions of the Subspace Network.

```
./subspace-farmer benchmark audit /path/to/your/plot
```

Replace /path/to/your/plot with the actual path to your plot. This will provide you with metrics and insights regarding plotting performance.

At the moment, Subspace Node supports two implementation mechanisms:

- `single`, that opens the file once and uses that for reading from multiple threads.
- `rayon`, that opens files as many times as there are farming threads and, for each thread, uses a dedicated file handle. **Rayon** is the library we use for multi-threading stuff.

To interpret the results: typically, you assess throughput to determine the required size of the SSD for efficient auditing. Both CPU and disk performance influence this metric, so adding a second disk of the same size may not necessarily double the time; its impact is likely to be less significant. Nonetheless, this approach provides you with a general understanding of performance.

To read more about audit benchmarking, [read this forum post](https://forum.subspace.network/t/audit-benchmark-result-explanation-please/2149).

There is a second command available, which helps you determine how much time your farmer has after auditing to provide proof.

```
./subspace-farmer benchmark prove /path/to/your/plot
```

Each farmer has ~4 seconds to audit and prove, so depending on how fast auditing is, the remaining time will be used for proving.
Proving performance doesnâ€™t depend on the plot size.

To read more about prove benchmarking, [read this forum post](https://forum.subspace.network/t/audit-benchmark-result-explanation-please/2150).

### Scrubbing Your Farmer
In certain situations, especially when the farmer terminates unexpectedly or encounters an error, it might fail to restart correctly. The scrub command assists in resolving such issues by cleaning or resetting the specified plot.

```
./subspace-farmer scrub /path/to/your/plot
```

Ensure to replace /path/to/your/plot with your actual plot path. Use this command cautiously as it modifies the plot state to recover from errors.

### Using a Custom Path
You can set a custom path for your node & farmer to use if you want to use an external hard drive, or set a custom path from the default. You can set the node and farmer to different directories if you would like.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="node" label="1.ðŸš© Node">

#### Set Node Custom Path.
To set your node to use a custom path all you will need to do is add the `--base-path` parameter.

```bash
# start node and store data in `NODE_DATA_PATH` instead of default location
./NODE_FILE_NAME --base-path NODE_DATA_PATH --chain gemini-3g ...`
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Switching to a new snapshot from older/different versions of Subspace

:::info
Unless specifically mentioned by the Development team you should **NOT** have to wipe & purge your configuration on new releases.
:::

In general you should be able to download the latest release, and re-start the Node & Farmer with the same commands as you started to prior version with no errors.

There are some cases where version updates will cause issue with your Node & Farmer and you may have to wipe & purge your node, typically when errors occur. If you have any issues you can always check our [Forums](https://forums.subspace.network) and hop in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/subspace-network) Server to ask for help.

### Wipe & Purge

If you were running a node previously, and want to switch to a new network, please perform these steps and then follow the guide again:
```bash
# Replace `FARMER_FILE_NAME` with the name of the farmer file you downloaded from releases
./FARMER_FILE_NAME wipe PATH_TO_FARM
# Replace `NODE_FILE_NAME` with the name of the node file you downloaded from releases
./NODE_FILE_NAME purge-chain --chain gemini-3g
```
It does not matter if the node/farmer executable is the previous one or from the new snapshot, both will work :)

Now follow installation guide.

### Docker Wipe & Purge

In case of Docker setup run `docker compose down -v` (and manually delete custom directories if you have specified them).

Now follow the installation guide.

If you are having issues with running a node or farmer for Subspace, feel free to join our Discord or even better you can take a look at our forums and review existing questions or post a new one if needed!

### Help

There are extra commands and parameters you can use on farmer or node, use the `--help` after any other command to display additional options.

```bash
# Replace `FARMER_FILE_NAME` with the name of the node file you downloaded from releases
./FARMER_FILE_NAME farm --help
```

### Timekeepers

Gemini-3g introduces Proof-of-Time and a new, optional role has been added to the node. Timekeepers help run PoT to ensure the security of the network. Timekeeping requires a high-performance core CPU but can be undertaken by any node runner. You can enable timekeeping with the following commands. 
- `--timekeeper`: To enable timekeeping on the node
- `--timekeeper-cpu-cores`: To specify which cores the Timekeeper will run on.

### Node & Farmer Commands Guide

Both the node and the farmer have a variety of flags and parameters. To see a full list, append the `--help` flag to either the node or the farmer command.

### Common Command Examples

:::note Farming Changes
Please note that as of `Gemini-3g` farming no longer occurs while plotting. This is to ensure the plotting process occurs in the most efficient manner. You can change this by adding the `--farm-during-initial-plotting` flag to the farmer. 
:::

For both the node and the farmer, here are some frequently used commands:

- Display farm information: `./FARMER_FILE_NAME info PATH_TO_FARM`
- Scrub the farm for errors: `./FARMER_FILE_NAME scrub PATH_TO_FARM`
- Erase all farmer-related data: `./FARMER_FILE_NAME wipe PATH_TO_FARM`
- Start the node with a custom data path: `./NODE_FILE_NAME --base-path NODE_DATA_PATH --chain gemini-3g`
- Erase all node-related data: `./NODE_FILE_NAME purge-chain --base-path NODE_DATA_PATH --chain gemini-3g`

### Utilizing Multiple Disks

To maximize storage capabilities, you can engage multiple disks directly. This is often more efficient than relying on RAID configurations:

Example:
```shell-session
./FARMER_FILE_NAME farm --reward-address WALLET_ADDRESS \
    path=/media/ssd1,size=100GiB \
    path=/media/ssd2,size=10T \
    path=/media/ssd3,size=10T
```

### Optimizing DSN Syncing

:::warning Parameters to Use with Caution
While it might be tempting to adjust certain parameters that seem related to DSN Syncing, it's advised to be cautious. Some options will not enhance syncing and are best left at their default values:

```
--out-peers
--in-peers
--in-peers-light
--dsn-target-connections
--dsn-pending-in-connections
--dsn-in-connections
```
:::

#### Recommended Parameters

The default parameters are set with the capabilities of common consumer modem/routers in mind. Adjusting certain parameters could enhance DSN sync performance by increasing parallelism. However, if you decide to increase them significantly, ensure that your modem/router is performant enough to handle the increased traffic.

**Node:**
```
--dsn-out-connections
--dsn-pending-out-connections
```

**Farmer:**
Increasing the values of the farmer parameters could increase the plotting speed.
```
--out-connections
--pending-out-connections
```
