### Adding Subspace RPC using MetaMask
---
You can use any EVM-compatible wallet, this guide will be using [**MetaMask**](https://metamask.io/) wallet.

First, let’s set up a MetaMask wallet and then go over connecting it to the Subspace Development Network.

1. Go to the [MetaMask Website](https://metamask.io/) and download an extension for your browser.
   Select your preferred language in the top-right corner. 
   Read and agree to MetaMask's terms of use.

2. Click on “Create a new wallet”.
  Read a note on gathering usage data and either agree to collect your anonymized data, or skip this step. It does not affect the creation of a wallet.

3. On the next screen you will be asked to create a password. Remember to always set a secure password that’s difficult to guess. Type your password twice before proceeding to the next step.

4. MetaMask automatically assesses the strength of your password. 
  :::tip
  As a rule of thumb, you should set a strong password, meaning that it includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.

10. To connect to Subspace RPC specify the values below

  ```
  Network Name: Subspace EVM
  New RPC URL: https://domain-3.evm.gemini-3g.subspace.network/ws
  Chain ID: 1002
  Currency Symbol: TSSC
  ```

You're all set, **you have successfully configured your MetaMask wallet** and connected it to **Subspace Core EVM**. To deploy your smart contract, you first need to get a small amount of **TSSC**  tokens into your wallet. Please make sure to refer to the [faucet section](./faucet.md) of the guide to learn more about getting test tokens.
