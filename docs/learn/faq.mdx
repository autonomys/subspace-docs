### What happened to testnet tokens? {#testnet-tokens}
📝 The testnet tokens (tSSC) earned during the various incentivized Gemini testnet phases were converted to mainnet tokens (AI3) at the time of the mainnet launch, and this conversion was included in the genesis block. The [Astral Testnet Rewards Checker](https://astral.autonomys.xyz/mainnet/testnet-rewards) allows you to see how much AI3 you were rewarded, proportional to your participation in the different testnet phases.

### When will the mainnet launch? {#mainnet-launch}
📝 The mainnet launched on November 6, 2024.  
<small><sub>📆 Last Updated: 2025-01-25</sub></small>

### When will token transfers be enabled? {#token-transfers}
📝 Token transfers will be enabled in Phase 2 of the mainnet, which will begin once all milestones are met. Please see the [Mainnet Phase 2 Roadmap](https://forum.autonomys.xyz/t/4755) for more details.

### How do you change the default ports? {#change-default-ports}

📝 If you need to change the default ports for the farmer and node, whether to run multiple instances on the same local network or to operate both the mainnet and the Taurus testnet at the same time, you must configure them to use unique ports.

<details>
<summary>CLI</summary>

Use the following parameters to assign new ports, ensuring they do not conflict with existing ones on the network:

<h2>Node</h2>
```shell
listen-on "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/30333"  
dsn-listen-on "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/30433"  
```

<h2>Farmer</h2>
```shell
listen-on "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/30533"  
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Space Acres</summary>

Open the **Hamburger Menu**, select **Change configuration**, then go to **Advanced configuration** to modify the port settings.
</details>
For more details, including steps to enable port forwarding, refer to the [Ports to Forward & Firewall Access](/farming/guides/port-config) guide.

### How long will it take to earn rewards? {#reward-time}
📝 Rewards are earned proportionally to the amount of storage you have pledged to the network. While there is a luck factor involved, you can estimate the time between wins using the [AI3 Rewards Calculator](https://ai3.farm/resources/rewards). This is a community provided tool.

### How long will it take to plot my farm? {#plotting-time}
📝 The initial plotting time depends on your hardware. Using a [supported GPU](/farming/guides/gpu-plotter) can significantly speed up the plotting process while consuming less power. However, CPU plotting is also supported if you prefer or don't have access to a compatible GPU. Once the initial plotting is complete, ongoing replotting (as sectors expire) will take less time. You can check out the [plotting speed results](https://ai3.farm/resources/plotting-speed) from community members to get an idea of what to expect based on different hardware setups.

### What are the hardware requirements? {#minimum-requirements}
📝 Please refer to the [Getting Started Guide](/farming/intro) for a list of minimum hardware and operating system requirements.  
<small><sub>📅 Last Updated: 2025-01-25</sub></small>

### What GPUs are supported? {#supported-gpus}
📝 Farming does not require or support the use of GPUs. For a list of compatible GPUs for plotting and replotting, please refer to the [GPU Plotter](/farming/guides/gpu-plotter) guide.
