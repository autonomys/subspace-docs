    <ContentText>
      The testnet tokens (tSSC) earned during the various incentivized Gemini testnet phases were converted to mainnet tokens (AI3) at the time of mainnet launch, and this conversion was included in the genesis block. The <Link to="https://github.com/subspace/incentivized-testnets">Incentivized Testnets Archive</Link> contains spreadsheets that allow you to see how much AI3 you were rewarded, proportional to your participation in the different testnet phases.

    <ContentText>
      The Autonomys Network mainnet officially launched on November 6, 2024, marking the beginning of Phase-1. This initial phase focused on establishing the network's core infrastructure and consensus mechanism, with token transfers initially disabled until the subsequent Phase-2 activation.

    title="When were token transfers enabled?" 
    slug="tge"

  >
    <ContentText>
      The Subspace Foundation activated mainnet transfers at block 3,585,226 on July 16th, 2025. This activation enabled native $AI3 token transfers on the Autonomys Network and marked the official beginning of Mainnet Phase-2. The economic layer of the protocol was unlocked at this time, allowing for on-chain $AI3 transactions. This milestone represented the culmination of years of research, engineering, testing, and community coordination.

      Rewards are earned proportionally to the amount of storage you have pledged to the network. While there is a luck factor involved, you can estimate the time between wins using the <Link to="https://ai3.farm/resources/rewards">AI3 Rewards Calculator</Link>. This is a community provided tool.

    title="How long will it take to plot my farm?" 
    slug="plotting-time"
    lastUpdated="2025-01-25"
  >
    <ContentText>
      The initial plotting time depends on your hardware. Using a <Link to="/farming/guides/gpu-plotter">supported GPU</Link> can significantly speed up the plotting process while consuming less power. However, CPU plotting is also supported if you prefer or don't have access to a compatible GPU. Once the initial plotting is complete, ongoing replotting (as sectors expire) will take less time. You can check out the <Link to="https://ai3.farm/resources/plotting-speed">plotting speed results</Link> from community members to get an idea of what to expect based on different hardware setups.

      Farming does not require or support the use of GPUs. For a list of compatible GPUs for plotting and replotting, please refer to the <Link to="/farming/guides/gpu-plotter">GPU Plotter</Link> guide.
