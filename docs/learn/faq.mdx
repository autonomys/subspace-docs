Welcome to the Autonomys Network FAQ! This comprehensive guide addresses the most common questions from our community, covering everything from network fundamentals to practical farming operations.

## Quick Navigation

- **[Network](#network)** - Learn about network statistics, RPC endpoints, token information, and mainnet milestones
- **[Farming](#farming)** - Get answers about hardware requirements, plotting times, port configuration, and earning rewards

We regularly update this FAQ based on community feedback and network developments.

    title="What happened to testnet tokens?" 
    id="testnet-tokens"
    lastUpdated="2025-05-30"
  >
    The testnet tokens (tSSC) earned during the various incentivized Gemini testnet phases were converted to mainnet tokens (AI3) at the time of mainnet launch, and this conversion was included in the genesis block. The <Link to="https://astral.autonomys.xyz/mainnet/testnet-rewards">Astral Testnet Rewards Checker</Link> allows you to see how much AI3 you were rewarded, proportional to your participation in the different testnet phases.

    title="How do you change the default ports?" 
    id="change-default-ports"
    lastUpdated="2025-02-03"
  >
    If you need to change the default ports for the farmer and node, whether to run multiple instances on the same local network or to operate both the mainnet and the Taurus testnet at the same time, you must configure them to use unique ports.
    
    <Tabs>
      <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI" default>
        <p>Use the following parameters to assign new ports, ensuring they do not conflict with existing ones on the network:</p>
        
        <h4>Node</h4>
        ```shell
        listen-on "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/30333"  
        dsn-listen-on "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/30433"  
        ```
        
        <h4>Farmer</h4>
        ```shell
        listen-on "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/30533"  
        ```

      <TabItem value="space-acres" label="Space Acres">
        <p>Open the <strong>Hamburger Menu</strong>, select <strong>Change configuration</strong>, then go to <strong>Advanced configuration</strong> to modify the port settings.</p>

  <CardItem 
    title="How long will it take to earn rewards?" 
    id="reward-time"
    lastUpdated="2025-01-25"
  >
    Rewards are earned proportionally to the amount of storage you have pledged to the network. While there is a luck factor involved, you can estimate the time between wins using the <Link to="https://ai3.farm/resources/rewards">AI3 Rewards Calculator</Link>. This is a community provided tool.

  <CardItem 
    title="How long will it take to plot my farm?" 
    id="plotting-time"
    lastUpdated="2025-01-25"
  >
    The initial plotting time depends on your hardware. Using a <Link to="/farming/guides/gpu-plotter">supported GPU</Link> can significantly speed up the plotting process while consuming less power. However, CPU plotting is also supported if you prefer or don't have access to a compatible GPU. Once the initial plotting is complete, ongoing replotting (as sectors expire) will take less time. You can check out the <Link to="https://ai3.farm/resources/plotting-speed">plotting speed results</Link> from community members to get an idea of what to expect based on different hardware setups.

  <CardItem 
    title="What are the hardware requirements?" 
    id="minimum-requirements"
    lastUpdated="2025-01-25"
  >
    Please refer to the <Link to="/farming/intro">Getting Started Guide</Link> for a list of minimum hardware and operating system requirements.

  <CardItem 
    title="What GPUs are supported?" 
    id="supported-gpus"
    lastUpdated="2025-01-25"

    Farming does not require or support the use of GPUs. For a list of compatible GPUs for plotting and replotting, please refer to the <Link to="/farming/guides/gpu-plotter">GPU Plotter</Link> guide.
