# üëãWelcome
The Autonomys Network is an ambitious layer zero protocol which is the first scalable, secure, & decentralized infrastructure layer for the Web3 ecosystems.

## ü§ù Participate on the Autonomys Network

### **Become a Farmer**

**Farmers** on the Autonomys Network are responsible for maintaining consensus. They do this by securing the consensus chain. A farmer plots pieces of archival history to disk, farms the created plot for block and vote rewards, and joins the DSN as a node for data retrieval.

Choose one of the following methods to start farming on the Network (from easy to more complex):

#### - [Start Farming with Space Acres](/farming/space-acres/install)
#### - [Start Farming with CLI](/farming/cli/install)

### **Become a Nominator**

**Farmers** can nominate **operators** by backing them with tokens, increasing their stake and chances of being elected as slot leaders. Any tAI3 token holder can stake their tokens by nominating them to a domain operator, without taking on the role of an operator or farmer. Nominators earn staking rewards proportional to their stake and pay the operator a pre-agreed fee.

#### - [Start Staking](/staking/stake)

### **Become an Operator**

**Operators** are responsible for validating and executing transactions, producing execution receipts, applying state transitions, and earning rewards for their work

#### - [Start an Operator node](/staking/operator/register)

### **Become a Timekeeper**

**Timekeepers** on the Autonomys Network are responsible for running the **Proof-of-Time chain** and maintaining the randomness beacon for the **consensus chain**.

### Utilize the Core Protocol
The Autonomys Network aims to provide an excellent developer experience for those building on the protocol. As such, we have developed various tools to assist and promote development on our network.
