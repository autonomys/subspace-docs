![Autonomys Network Introduction](/img/learn/intro-banner.avif)

Welcome to the Autonomys Network, the foundation for a radically decentralized future!  

Whether you're a **farmer** ready to contribute storage and earn rewards, an **operator** looking to validate transactions and secure domains, a **nominator** wanting to stake your tokens, or a **developer** building the next generation of Web3 applications, you've found your home.

The Autonomys Network isn't just another blockchain. As the world's first truly scalable layer-zero protocol, we've solved the blockchain trilemma by separating consensus from computation. This means farmers can participate with everyday hardware while the network maintains unprecedented security and scalability. Our innovative Proof-of-Archival-Storage consensus enables anyone, anywhere, to join the network and earn rewards by storing humanity's digital history.

Join thousands of farmers across the globe who are already securing the network, earning rewards, and building the decentralized infrastructure that will power the next era of the internet. Together, we're not just participants, we're pioneers shaping the future of Web3.
