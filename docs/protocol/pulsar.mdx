:::tip Recommended
[Pulsar](https://github.com/subspace/pulsar) (previously Subspace CLI or Simple CLI) is the recommended way to farm on the Subspace Network. To get started, follow the guide below. For more information, you can check out the project [README on GitHub](https://github.com/subspace/pulsar/blob/main/README.md).
:::

## Pre-Requisites

---

### System Requirements

:::danger Farming can be Network Intensive.

Make sure you have a stable network connection. During the plotting phase of farming, it can be network intensive.

This may impact your network usage so please check your network connection if you have a hard data limit.
:::

Pulsar requires commodity hardware specs to operate. At a **minimum**, it is recommended to have:

| Hardware | Specs            |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| CPU      | 4 Core+          |
| RAM      | 8GB+             |
| SWAP     | 4GB              |
| Storage  | 100GB SSD        |

:::note SWAP Warning
A swap is only necessary if you have a low amount of RAM. 
:::

:::note CoW Filesystems Warning
It is advised not to use the Subspace farmer and node on CoW file systems for any OS (ReFS, BTRFS, ZFS, bcachefs, HAMMER and some more).

If BTRFS is used with Subspace, the directory/whole file system must be CoW disabled with the following command prior to starting Subspace, because it only applies to newly created files.

**Command to Disable CoW on BTRFS**

```
sudo chattr +C path/to/data/dir
```

Alternatively, non-CoW file systems like ext4 or XFS can be used instead.
:::

:::note Redundancy
Using redundancy (RAID1/5/6, RAIDZ and others) on a filesystem with plot makes no sense, as the farmer uses checksums to verify the integrity of the plot, and is able to recover corrupted blocks if necessary in most cases. See `scrub` command below.
:::

:::tip Filesystem chunk size
Creating a filesystem with a chunk (sunit) size of 32KB can prevent data fragmentation and improve performance, since the farmer operates on ~32KB chunks.

**XFS**

```
sudo mkfs.xfs -d su=32k,sw=1 /path/to/dev
```

Then use `largeio` and `swalloc` mount options.

**ext4**

```
sudo mkfs.ext4 -E stride=8,stripe-width=8 /path/to/dev
```

You can change these settings for an existing file system:

```
sudo tune2fs -E stride=8,stripe-width=8 /path/to/dev
```

### Getting A Crypto Wallet

Before running anything you need to have a wallet where you'll receive testnet coins.
Follow our how-to guides in the [Wallets section](/docs/category/wallets/) of the documentation for steps on how to get your wallet setup.

### Required ports

Currently, a few ports need to be exposed for node to work properly.

If you have a server with no firewall, there is nothing to be done, but otherwise make sure to open the following TCP ports for incoming connections.

- `30333`
- `30433`
- `30533`

On the desktop side if you have a router in front of your computer, you'll need to forward TCP ports to the machine on which your node is running (how this is done varies from router to router, but there is always a feature like this, refer to [How to Forward Ports](port-forwarding.md) for a more in-depth tutorial).
If you're connected directly without any router, then again nothing needs to be done in such case.

### Configuration

---

To start we have to initialize our Farmer, this can be done with:

<Tabs groupId="OS">
<TabItem value="windows" label="🖼️ Windows" default>

```powershell
./pulsar-windows-x86_64-skylake-v0.6.4-alpha.exe init
```

:::note High RAM consumption
  Operating systems, such as Windows, allocate memory for both visible tasks and behind-the-scenes processes. 
  While this memory can be readily freed when necessary, Windows occasionally may not display these allocations accurately due to certain system nuances.
  High RAM consumption should not be a cause for concern.
:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="macos" label="🍎 macOS">
Intel Chip:

```bash

./pulsar-macos-x86_64-v0.6.4-alpha  init

```
Apple M Series:

```bash

./pulsar-macos-aarch64-v0.6.4-alpha init

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="linux" label="🐧 Ubuntu">
Ubuntu:

```bash

```
Ubuntu Executable (aarch64):

```bash

./pulsar-ubuntu-aarch64-v0.6.4-alpha  init

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will prompt you to setup your Pulsar configurations to begin farming. You should see a similar prompt like so (some info might be different than shown here w.r.t your OS):

```text
version: 0.6.0

Configuration creation process has started...
Do you have an existing farmer/reward address? [y/n]: y
Enter your farmer/reward address: REDACTED_ADDRESS
Enter your node name to be identified on the network (defaults to `username`, press enter to use the default):
Specify a path for storing plot files (press enter to use the default: `"/home/username/.local/share/pulsar/farms"`):
Specify a path for storing node files (press enter to use the default: `"/home/username/.local/share/pulsar/node"`):
Specify a plot size (defaults to `2.0 GB`, press enter to use the default):
Specify the chain to farm. Available options are: [Gemini3f, Dev, DevNet].
Defaults to `Gemini3f`, press enter to use the default:
Configuration has been generated at /home/username/.config/pulsar
Ready for lift off! Run the follow command to begin: `"path/to/executable" farm`
```

:::info Finding your settings.toml

After running `pulsar init`, the prompt will display where the `settings.toml` is generated. However in case you missed it, you can find the file based on your operating system:

<Tabs groupId="OS">
<TabItem value="windows" label="🖼️ Windows" default>

Your `settings.toml` will be found in `$FOLDERID_RoamingAppData/pulsar/settings.toml`

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="macos" label="🍎macOS">

Your `settings.toml` will be found in `$HOME/Library/Application Support/pulsar/settings.toml`

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="linux" label="🐧Ubuntu">

Your `settings.toml` will be found in `$HOME/.config/pulsar/settings.toml`

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::

### Gemini 3 Testnet

---

If you are using the default configurations from Pulsar, you are ready to go with the Gemini 3 Testnet. Alternatively, you can ensure this occurs by manually setting the network like so.

Open your `settings.toml` directory and ensure your `chain` is correctly specified to `gemini-3f` as so:

```toml
# settings.toml
[node]
chain = 'gemini-3f'
# ... redacted ...
```

### Local Development

---

To run Pulsar in a local development mode, modify your `settings.toml` and ensure your `chain` points to `dev`:

```toml
# settings.toml
[node]
chain = 'dev'
# ... redacted ...
```

## Farming

---

To begin farming on the network, just run the `farm` command with the CLI like so:

<Tabs groupId="OS">
<TabItem value="windows" label="🖼️ Windows" default>

```powershell
./pulsar-windows-x86_64-skylake-v0.6.4-alpha.exe farm
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="macos" label="🍎 macOS">

Intel Chip:

```bash

./pulsar-macos-x86_64-v0.6.4-alpha farm

```
Apple M1 Chip:

```bash

./pulsar-macos-aarch64-v0.6.4-alpha farm

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="linux" label="🐧 Ubuntu">

Ubuntu:

```bash

./pulsar-ubuntu-x86_64-skylake-v0.6.4-alpha farm

```
Ubuntu Executable (aarch64):

```bash

./pulsar-ubuntu-aarch64-v0.6.4-alpha farm

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You should see the farmer and node start successfully and begin syncing, plotting, and then farming:

```text
Starting node ... (this might take up to couple of minutes)
Node started successfully!
Starting farmer ...
Farmer started successfully!
Initial plotting for plot: #0 (/home/username/.local/share/pulsar/farms)
⠁ [00:00:00] 3% [=>                                      ]
      (31.00 MiB/953.67 MiB) 157.35 GiB/s, plotting, ETA: 0s
```

That's it! Enjoy and Happy Farming!

## Having Trouble?

If you are facing issues with your node/farmer you can try a few of the following things below, if you are unable to get your issue resolved please check our [Forums](https://forums.subspace.network) to see if your issue may have been solved, if its a new one feel free to post it! You can also join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/subspace-network) for additional Peer to Peer help.

:::info

We have included a few tutorials below that may help you in your support journey, this is not an all inclusive list but we welcome contributions

:::

### Wipe Node & Farmer

:::tip Updated from a previous version and now having issues?

Occasionally after updating to a new version of the Pulsar you will need to wipe your node and farmer, generally this should not be required but can be attempted if your farmer is having issues after having had worked fine previously.

:::

To simply restart the node, go to the terminal where you started the `farm` command, and press `Ctrl + C` you should see a shutdown message appear and the application will attempt a simple shutdown, if you dont see the message press `Ctrl + C` again to force shutdown. You can then simply start the farmer again with the `farm` command you used prior.

Use the same file name as the previous init and farm steps, then add the wipe command to free the previous storage that was being used. Generally, only do this if you have severe errors and are prompted by a staff member.

```bash
./pulsar-file-name wipe
```

After wiping, follow the `init` and `farm` steps above to start farming again!

### View your Logs

A good place to start if you are facing trouble is by viewing your logs and seeing if there are any errors or insights that might be available. You can find the location for your logs below

### Enable Rust Backtrace 

When running the Subspace Network Farmer & Node, sometimes you may encounter an error message that includes a line similar to the following:

```
Backtrace omitted. Run with RUST_BACKTRACE=1 environment variable to display it.
```

This error message means that Rust (the programming language that Subspace Network Farmer & Node is written in) has encountered a problem and has provided a diagnostic backtrace that can help diagnose the issue. However, by default, the backtrace is not displayed. To see the backtrace, you need to enable the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable.

In this section, we will show you how to enable the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable on Linux, macOS, and Windows (PowerShell).

<Tabs groupId="OS">
<TabItem value="windows" label="🖼️ Windows" default>

#### Enabling RUST_BACKTRACE on Windows (PowerShell)
