:::caution Advanced Usage
[Pulsar](https://github.com/subspace/pulsar) (previously Simple CLI or Subspace CLI) is the recommended way to farm on the Subspace Network. Follow the guide below to get started or check out the project [README on GitHub](https://github.com/subspace/pulsar/blob/main/README.md).

## I. Pre-requisites

---

### A. System Requirements

:::danger Farming can be Network Intensive.

Make sure you have a stable network connection. During the plotting phase of farming, it can be network intensive.

This may impact your network usage so please check your network connection if you have a hard data limit.
:::

|Hardware|Specs|
|-|-|
|CPU|4 Core+|
|RAM|8GB+|
|SWAP|4GB|
|Storage|100GB SSD|

:::note SWAP Warning
A swap is only necessary if you have a low amount of RAM. 
:::

:::note CoW Filesystems Warning
It is advised not to use the Subspace farmer and node on CoW file systems for any OS (ReFS, BTRFS, ZFS, bcachefs, HAMMER and some more).

If BTRFS is used with Subspace, the directory/whole file system must be CoW disabled with the following command prior to starting Subspace, because it only applies to newly created files.

**Command to Disable CoW on BTRFS**

```shell-session
sudo chattr +C path/to/data/dir
```

Alternatively, non-CoW file systems like ext4 or XFS can be used instead.
:::

:::note Redundancy
Using redundancy (RAID1/5/6, RAIDZ and others) on a filesystem with plot makes no sense, as the farmer uses checksums to verify the integrity of the plot, and is able to recover corrupted blocks if necessary in most cases. See `scrub` command below.
:::

:::tip Filesystem chunk size
Creating a filesystem with a chunk (sunit) size of 32KB can prevent data fragmentation and improve performance, since the farmer operates on ~32KB chunks.

**XFS**

```shell-session
sudo mkfs.xfs -d su=32k,sw=1 /path/to/dev
```

Then use `largeio` and `swalloc` mount options.

**ext4**

```shell-session
sudo mkfs.ext4 -E stride=8,stripe-width=8 /path/to/dev
```

You can change these settings for an existing file system:

```shell-session
sudo tune2fs -E stride=8,stripe-width=8 /path/to/dev
```

:::

### B. Crypto Wallet

Before running anything you need to have a wallet where you'll receive testnet coins. There are currently two wallets we suggest using, SubWallet being the preferred route.
- [SubWallet](https://subwallet.app/)
- [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/)

Install one of the two wallets above into your browser and create a new account there.
The address of your account will be necessary at the last step.

For help refer to our forum post [How to setup Subwallet & a Polkadot.js Wallet](https://forum.subspace.network/t/subspace-wallet/61)
- *make sure to follow the Bonus section of the bottom of the post above.*


### C. Required ports

Currently, a few ports need to be exposed for node to work properly.

If you have a server with no firewall, there is nothing to be done, but otherwise make sure to open the following TCP and UDP ports for incoming connections.

- `30333`
- `30433`
- `30533`

On the desktop side if you have a router in front of your computer, you'll need to forward TCP and UDP ports to the machine on which your node is running (how this is done varies from router to router, but there is always a feature like this, refer to [How to Forward Ports](port-forwarding.md) for a more in-depth tutorial).
If you're connected directly without any router, then again nothing needs to be done in such case.




## II. Installation

---

:::tip Looking for all Releases?
You can always find these executables in the [Releases](https://github.com/subspace/subspace/releases) section on our GitHub
:::



We will be downloading two files for your respective operating system.
1. `Subspace-Node` - This is the executable that actually makes the connection with the Subspace Network
2. `Subspace-Farmer` - This is the executable that will actually farm for rewards on your allocated storage plot.

- *Those using Docker will not have to download anything, just configure the `docker-compose.yaml`*


<Tabs groupId="OS">

<TabItem value="docker" label="üêã Docker" default>

  1. Input your parameters in the provided form and click `Generate`. 
	 Don't forget to specify your reward address instead of a default one!
	 
  <DockerFileGenerator />
  
  2. Copy the generated `docker-compose.yaml` file.

  3. Create the `subspace` directory and the `docker-compose.yaml` file in it. Paste the output from the generator into the file.
  
  4. Now go to directory with `docker-compose.yaml` and type `docker compose up -d` to start everything

  You can read logs with `docker compose logs --tail=1000 -f`, for the rest read [Docker Compose CLI reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/).

:::caution  Windows No Output Bug

  If you face an error where the node outputs nothing and no error code is given it is likely you just need to install the latest Visual C++ Redistributable package [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)

:::

:::note High RAM consumption
  Operating systems, such as Windows, allocate memory for both visible tasks and behind-the-scenes processes. 
  While this memory can be readily freed when necessary, Windows occasionally may not display these allocations accurately due to certain system nuances.
  High RAM consumption should not be a cause for concern.
:::

  1. Open `Powershell` (we do not recommend using Command Prompt as its syntax is slightly different)
  2. In the terminal we will change to the Downloads directory using this command `cd Downloads`
  3. We will then start the node using the following command
  > You may get a popup asking for firewall permission, make sure to click `Allow`


  ```powershell
  # Replace `INSERT_YOUR_ID` with a nickname you choose
  # Copy all of the lines below, they are all part of the same command
  .\subspace-node-windows-x86_64-skylake-gemini-3g-2023-nov-09.exe `
    --chain gemini-3g `
    --blocks-pruning 256 `
    --state-pruning archive-canonical `
    --no-private-ipv4 `
    --validator `
    --name "INSERT_YOUR_ID"
  ```

:::caution Minimum macOS Version

  The minimum support macOS version is version 12+

:::

  1. Open your favorite terminal, and change to the Downloads directory using `cd Downloads`
  2. Make the farmer & node executable:
  - `chmod +x subspace-farmer-macos-aarch64-gemini-3g-2023-nov-09`
  - `chmod +x subspace-node-macos-aarch64-gemini-3g-2023-nov-09`
  1. We will then start the node using the following command

  > *Note, when attempting to run this command you may be prompted:* Click on `cancel` instead of moving it to trash.
  To allow execution, go to `System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General`, and click on `allow`.
  After this, simply repeat the step you prompted for (step 4 or 6). This time, click the `Open` button when prompted.

  ```bash
  # Replace `INSERT_YOUR_ID` with a nickname you choose
  # Copy all of the lines below, they are all part of the same command
  ./subspace-node-macos-aarch64-gemini-3g-2023-nov-09 \

:::caution Linux File Descriptor Limit

  The Linux system has a hard file descriptor limit of 100k. If this is exceeded, an error will be thrown. For reference, Substrate by default has a 10k hard file descriptor limit.

  The limit can generally be found on the path /proc/sys/fs/file-max. It is recommended to change the limit to 100k if it is not already. Here is an example [tutorial.](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/increase-number-of-maximum-open-files-in-linux)

:::

  ### Required dependencies
  There are two packages that are typically already installed, but might be missing on your machine.

  If you see this error:
  > error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

  Make sure to install `libgomp1` library with `sudo apt-get install libgomp1`.

  ---
  1. Open your favorite terminal, and change to the Downloads directory using `cd Downloads`
  2. Make the farmer & node executable
  - `chmod +x subspace-farmer-ubuntu-x86_64-skylake-gemini-3g-2023-nov-09`
  - `chmod +x subspace-node-ubuntu-x86_64-skylake-gemini-3g-2023-nov-09`
  3. We will then start the node using the following command

  ```bash
    # Replace `INSERT_YOUR_ID` with a nickname you choose
    # Copy all of the lines below, they are all part of the same command
    ./subspace-node-ubuntu-x86_64-skylake-gemini-3g-2023-nov-09 \
      --chain gemini-3g \
      --blocks-pruning 256 \

      --no-private-ipv4 \
      --validator \
      --name "INSERT_YOUR_ID"
  ```

### Useful Commands

Start Node:
```shell-session
sudo systemctl start subspace-node
```

Start Farmer:
```shell-session
sudo systemctl start subspace-farmer
```

Stop Node:
```shell-session
sudo systemctl stop subspace-node
```

Stop Farmer:
```shell-session
sudo systemctl stop subspace-farmer
```

Enable Node (for automatic startup on system boot):
```shell-session
sudo systemctl enable subspace-node
```

Enable Farmer (for automatic startup on system boot):
```shell-session
sudo systemctl enable subspace-farmer
```

Disable Node (to prevent automatic startup on system boot):
```shell-session
sudo systemctl disable subspace-node
```

Disable Node (to prevent automatic startup on system boot):
```shell-session
sudo systemctl disable subspace-farmer
```

Check Node Service Status:
```shell-session
sudo systemctl status subspace-node

View Node Logs:
```shell-session
sudo journalctl -f -o cat -u subspace-node
```

View Farmer Logs:
```shell-session
sudo journalctl -f -o cat -u subspace-farmer
```

Count Farmer Rewards Received in the Last Hour:
```shell-session
sudo journalctl -o cat -u subspace-farmer --since="1 hour ago" | grep -i "Successfully signed reward hash" | wc -l
```

---

### Upgrade

To upgrade a node and farmer, first, stop running services:
```shell-session
sudo systemctl stop subspace-{node,farmer}
```

After using the commands from the beginning of the manual, download the executable files of the new release.
And if you installed under a regular user, you will need to switch to that user beforehand.

Now you can start the services:
```shell-session
sudo systemctl start subspace-{node,farmer}
```

## III. Post Node & Farmer Install Care

---

Now that your Node & Farmer have been started you will wait for the node to sync and the farmer to complete the initial plotting. While this is occurring you can check out some of the helpful resources below.

**- [Telemetry Server](https://telemetry.subspace.network/#list/0x92e91e657747c41eeabed5129ff51689d2e935b9f6abfbd5dfcb2e1d0d035095)**


**- [Block Explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc-0.gemini-3g.subspace.network%2Fws#/explorer)**


### Using a Custom Path
You can set a custom path for your node & farmer to use if you want to use an external hard drive, or set a custom path from the default. You can set the node and farmer to different directories if you would like.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="node" label="1.üö© Node">

#### Set Node Custom Path.
To set your node to use a custom path all you will need to do is add the `--base-path` parameter.

```bash
# start node and store data in `NODE_DATA_PATH` instead of default location
./NODE_FILE_NAME --base-path NODE_DATA_PATH --chain gemini-3g ...`
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Switching to a new snapshot from older/different versions of Subspace

:::info
Unless specifically mentioned by the Development team you should **NOT** have to wipe & purge your configuration on new releases.
:::

In general you should be able to download the latest release, and re-start the Node & Farmer with the same commands as you started to prior version with no errors.

There are some cases where version updates will cause issue with your Node & Farmer and you may have to wipe & purge your node, typically when errors occur. If you have any issues you can always check our [Forums](https://forums.subspace.network) and hop in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/subspace-network) Server to ask for help.

#### Wipe & Purge

If you were running a node previously, and want to switch to a new snapshot, please perform these steps and then follow the guideline again:
```bash
# Replace `FARMER_FILE_NAME` with the name of the node file you downloaded from releases
./FARMER_FILE_NAME wipe PATH_TO_FARM
# Replace `NODE_FILE_NAME` with the name of the node file you downloaded from releases
./NODE_FILE_NAME purge-chain --chain gemini-3g
```
Does not matter if the node/farmer executable is the previous one or from the new snapshot, both will work :)
The reason we require this is, with every snapshot change, the network might get partitioned, and you may be on a different genesis than the current one.
In plain English, these commands are like a `reset` button for snapshot changes.

Now follow installation guide.

#### Docker Wipe & Purge

In case of Docker setup run `docker compose down -v` (and manually delete custom directories if you have specified them).

Now follow installation guide.

#### Help

There are extra commands and parameters you can use on farmer or node, use the `--help` after any other command to display additional options.

```bash
# Replace `FARMER_FILE_NAME` with the name of the node file you downloaded from releases
./FARMER_FILE_NAME farm --help
```

## IV. Advanced

---
### Timekeepers

Gemini-3g introduces Proof-of-Time and a new, optional role has been added to the node. Timekeepers help run PoT to ensure the security of the network. Timekeeping requires a high-performance core CPU but can be undertaken by any node runner. You can enable timekeeping with the following commands. 
- `--timekeeper`: To enable timekeeping on the node
- `--timekeeper-cpu-cores`: To specify which cores the Timekeeper will run on. 


### Node & Farmer Commands Guide

Both the node and the farmer have a variety of flags and parameters. To see a full list, append the `--help` flag to either the node or the farmer command.

### Common Command Examples

:::note Farming Changes
Please note that as of `Gemini-3g` farming no longer occurs while plotting. This is to ensure the plotting process occurs in the most efficient manner. You can change this by adding the `--farm-during-initial-plotting` flag to the farmer. 
:::

For both the node and the farmer, here are some frequently used commands:

- Display farm information: `./FARMER_FILE_NAME info PATH_TO_FARM`
- Scrub the farm for errors: `./FARMER_FILE_NAME scrub PATH_TO_FARM`
- Erase all farmer-related data: `./FARMER_FILE_NAME wipe PATH_TO_FARM`
- Start the node with a custom data path: `./NODE_FILE_NAME --base-path NODE_DATA_PATH --chain gemini-3g`
- Erase all node-related data: `./NODE_FILE_NAME purge-chain --base-path NODE_DATA_PATH --chain gemini-3g`

### Utilizing Multiple Disks

To maximize storage capabilities, you can engage multiple disks directly. This is often more efficient than relying on RAID configurations:

Example:
```shell-session
./FARMER_FILE_NAME farm --reward-address WALLET_ADDRESS \
    path=/media/ssd1,size=100GiB \
    path=/media/ssd2,size=10T \
    path=/media/ssd3,size=10T
```

### Optimizing DSN Syncing

:::warning Parameters to Use with Caution
While it might be tempting to adjust certain parameters that seem related to DSN Syncing, it's advised to be cautious. Some options will not enhance syncing and are best left at their default values:

```
--out-peers
--in-peers
--in-peers-light
--dsn-target-connections
--dsn-pending-in-connections
--dsn-in-connections
```
:::

#### Recommended Parameters

The default parameters are set with the capabilities of common consumer modem/routers in mind. Adjusting certain parameters could enhance DSN sync performance by increasing parallelism. However, if you decide to increase them significantly, ensure that your modem/router is performant enough to handle the increased traffic.

**Node:**
```
--dsn-out-connections
--dsn-pending-out-connections
```

**Farmer:**
Increasing the values of the farmer parameters could increase the plotting speed.
```
--out-connections
--pending-out-connections
```

### Build from source (Linux)

If you're running unsupported Linux distribution or CPU architecture, you may try to build binaries yourself from source.

NOTE: This is primarily targeted at tech-savvy users and not recommended unless you know what you're doing.
Please try to find answer to your question online before reaching out to maintainers.

You'll have to have [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) installed as well as LLVM, Clang and CMake in addition to usual developer tooling (Ubuntu example):
```text
sudo apt-get install llvm clang cmake
```

:::warning LLVM + Clang 16
The build with LLVM + Clang 16 ends with `UnknownOpcode(192)` error due to breaking changes concerning WASM in LLVM 16. You can read more about this issue [here](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/13636). At this point, the solution is to use LLVM + Clang 15 and add the `-Z build-std` flag to the `cargo build` command. 
:::

Now clone the source and build snapshot `snapshot-2023-aug-18` (replace occurrences with the snapshot you want to build):
```shell-session
git clone https://github.com/subspace/subspace.git
cd subspace
git checkout snapshot-2023-aug-18
cargo build \
    --profile production \
    --bin subspace-node \
    --bin subspace-farmer
```

You'll find two binaries under `target/production` directory once it succeeds, after which refer to instructions above on how to use them.

### Enable Rust Backtrace 

When running the Subspace Network Farmer & Node, sometimes you may encounter an error message that includes a line similar to the following:

```text
Backtrace omitted. Run with RUST_BACKTRACE=1 environment variable to display it.
```

This error message means that Rust (the programming language that Subspace Network Farmer & Node is written in) has encountered a problem and has provided a diagnostic backtrace that can help diagnose the issue. However, by default, the backtrace is not displayed. To see the backtrace, you need to enable the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable.

In this section, we will show you how to enable the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable on Linux, macOS, and Windows (PowerShell).

#### Enabling RUST_BACKTRACE on Linux Service

To enable the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable on Linux Service, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. If you want to enable it for the node, then run the following command:
   ```shell-session
   sudo systemctl edit subspace-node
   ```
   
   If you want to enable it for the farmer, then run the following command:
   ```shell-session
   sudo systemctl edit subspace-farmer
   ```
3. Between the warning comments, add two lines to the file:
   ```shell-session
   [Service]
   Environment=RUST_BACKTRACE=1
   ```
4. Reload systemd daemon:
   ```shell-session
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```
5. Restart services:
   ```shell-session
   sudo systemctl restart subspace-{node,farmer}
   ```
   
If you want to disable `RUST_BACKTRACE`, just follow the same steps above, 
but in step 3 instead of adding, remove those 2 lines.
