:::caution Advanced Usage
[Subspace CLI](https://github.com/subspace/subspace-cli) is the recommended way to farm on the Subspace Network. Follow the guide below to get started or check out the project [README on GitHub](https://github.com/subspace/subspace-cli/blob/main/README.md).
:::

## I. Pre-requisites

---

### A. System Requirements

:::note Network Warning
You will also want to ensure you have a stable Network connection. It is also important to note that plotting can be network intensive and may impact network usage if you have a hard data limit.
:::

:::note CoW File Systems Warning
It is advised not to use the Subspace farmer and node on CoW file systems for any OS.

If BTRFS is used with Subspace, the directory/whole file system must be CoW disabled with the following command prior to starting Subspace.

**Command to Cow Disable**
```
sudo chattr +C path/to/data
```
Alternatively, non-CoW file systems like ext4 or xfs can be used instead.

### B. Crypto Wallet

Before running anything you need to have a wallet where you'll receive testnet coins. There are currently two wallets we suggest using, SubWallet being the preferred route.
- [SubWallet](https://subwallet.app/)
- [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/)

Install one of the two wallets above into your browser and create a new account there.
The address of your account will be necessary at the last step.

For help refer to our forum post [How to setup Subwallet & a Polkadot.js Wallet](https://forum.subspace.network/t/subspace-wallet/61)
- *make sure to follow the Bonus section of the bottom of the post above.*


### D. Required ports

Currently, a few ports need to be exposed for node to work properly.

If you have a server with no firewall, there is nothing to be done, but otherwise make sure to open the following TCP ports for incoming connections.

- `30333`
- `30433`
- `30533`

On the desktop side if you have a router in front of your computer, you'll need to forward TCP ports to the machine on which your node is running (how this is done varies from router to router, but there is always a feature like this, refer to [How to Forward Ports](port-forwarding.md) for a more in-depth tutorial).
If you're connected directly without any router, then again nothing needs to be done in such case.




## II. Installation

---

:::tip Looking for all Releases?
You can always find these executables in the [Releases](https://github.com/subspace/subspace/releases) section on our GitHub
:::



We will be downloading two files for your respective operating system.
1. `Subspace-Node` - This is the executable that actually makes the connection with the Subspace Network
2. `Subspace-Farmer` - This is the executable that will actually farm for rewards on your allocated storage plot.

- *Those using Docker will not have to download anything, just configure the `docker-compose.yml`*


<Tabs groupId="OS">

<TabItem value="docker" label="üêã Docker" default>

  1. Create `subspace` directory and `docker-compose.yml` in it with following contents:

  ````yml
  version: "3.7"
  services:
  node:
    # Replace `snapshot-DATE` with the latest release (like `snapshot-2023-aug-18`)
    # For running on Aarch64 add `-aarch64` after `DATE`
    image: ghcr.io/subspace/node:snapshot-DATE
    volumes:
  # Instead of specifying volume (which will store data in `/var/lib/docker`), you can
  # alternatively specify path to the directory where files will be stored, just make
  # sure everyone is allowed to write there
      - node-data:/var/subspace:rw
  #   - /path/to/subspace-node:/var/subspace:rw
    ports:
  # If port 30333 or 30433 is already occupied by another Substrate-based node, replace all
  # occurrences of `30333` or `30433` in this file with another value
      - "0.0.0.0:30333:30333"
      - "0.0.0.0:30433:30433"
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: [
      "--chain", "gemini-3f",
      "--base-path", "/var/subspace",
      "--execution", "wasm",
      "--blocks-pruning", "256",
      "--state-pruning", "archive",
      "--port", "30333",
      "--dsn-listen-on", "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/30433",
      "--rpc-cors", "all",
      "--rpc-methods", "unsafe",
      "--rpc-external",
      "--no-private-ipv4",
      "--validator",
    # Replace `INSERT_YOUR_ID` with your node ID (will be shown in telemetry)
      "--name", "INSERT_YOUR_ID"
    ]
    healthcheck:
      timeout: 5s
    # If node setup takes longer than expected, you want to increase `interval` and `retries` number.
      interval: 30s
      retries: 60

      farmer:
        depends_on:
          node:
            condition: service_healthy
        # Replace `snapshot-DATE` with latest release (like `snapshot-2023-aug-18`)
        # For running on Aarch64 add `-aarch64` after `DATE`
        image: ghcr.io/subspace/farmer:snapshot-DATE
        volumes:
    # Instead of specifying volume (which will store data in `/var/lib/docker`), you can
    # alternatively specify path to the directory where files will be stored, just make
    # sure everyone is allowed to write there
        - farmer-data:/var/subspace:rw
    #   - /path/to/subspace-farmer:/var/subspace:rw
    ports:
    # If port 30533 is already occupied by something else, replace all
    # occurrences of `30533` in this file with another value
        - "0.0.0.0:30533:30533"
      restart: unless-stopped
      command: [
        "farm",
        "--node-rpc-url", "ws://node:9944",
        "--listen-on", "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/30533",
        # Replace `WALLET_ADDRESS` with your Polkadot.js wallet address
        "--reward-address", "WALLET_ADDRESS",
        # Replace `PLOT_SIZE` with plot size in gigabytes or terabytes, for example 100G or 2T (but leave at least 60G of disk space for node and some for OS)
        "path=/var/subspace,size=PLOT_SIZE",
      ]
      volumes:
        node-data:
        farmer-data:
  ```

  2. Now edit created file:

    - Replace snapshot-DATE with the latest release (not pre-release!) snapshot (like snapshot-2023-aug-18)
    - Replace INSERT_YOUR_ID with desired name that will be shown in telemetry (doesn't impact anything else)
    - Replace WALLET_ADDRESS with your wallet address
    - Replace PLOT_SIZE with plot size in gigabytes or terabytes, for example 100G or 2T (but leave at least 10G of disk space for node)
  
  *If you want to store files on a separate disk or customize port, read comments in the file.*

  3. Now go to directory with `docker-compose.yml` and type `docker-compose up -d` to start everything

  You can read logs with `docker-compose logs --tail=1000 -f`, for the rest read [Docker Compose CLI reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/).

:::caution  Windows No Output Bug

  If you face an error where the node outputs nothing and no error code is given it is likely you just need to install the latest Visual C++ Redistributable package [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)

:::

  1. Open `Powershell` (we do not recommend using Command Prompt as its syntax is slightly different)
  2. In the terminal we will change to the Downloads directory using this command `cd Downloads`
  3. We will then start the node using the following command
  > You may get a popup asking for firewall permission, make sure to click `Allow`

  ```PowerShell
  # Replace `INSERT_YOUR_ID` with a nickname you choose
  # Copy all of the lines below, they are all part of the same command
  .\subspace-node-windows-x86_64-skylake-gemini-3f-2023-aug-18.exe `
    --chain gemini-3f `
    --execution wasm `
    --blocks-pruning 256 `
    --state-pruning archive `
    --no-private-ipv4 `
    --validator `
    --name "INSERT_YOUR_ID"
  ```
  
  4. You should see something similar in the terminal:

:::caution Minimum macOS Version

  The minimum support macOS version is version 12+

:::

  1. Open your favorite terminal, and change to the Downloads directory using `cd Downloads`
  2. Make the farmer & node executable:
  - `chmod +x subspace-farmer-macos-aarch64-gemini-3f-2023-aug-18`
  - `chmod +x subspace-node-macos-aarch64-gemini-3f-2023-aug-18`
  1. We will then start the node using the following command

  > *Note, when attempting to run this command you may be prompted:* Click on `cancel` instead of moving it to trash.
  To allow execution, go to `System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General`, and click on `allow`.
  After this, simply repeat the step you prompted for (step 4 or 6). This time, click the `Open` button when prompted.

  ```bash
  # Replace `INSERT_YOUR_ID` with a nickname you choose
  # Copy all of the lines below, they are all part of the same command
  ./subspace-node-macos-aarch64-gemini-3f-2023-aug-18 \

:::caution Linux File Descriptor Limit

  The Linux system has a hard file descriptor limit of 100k. If this is exceeded, an error will be thrown. For reference, Substrate by default has a 10k hard file descriptor limit.

  The limit can generally be found on the path /proc/sys/fs/file-max. It is recommended to change the limit to 100k if it is not already. Here is an example [tutorial.](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/increase-number-of-maximum-open-files-in-linux)

:::

  ### Required dependencies
  There are two packages that are typically already installed, but might be missing on your machine.

  If you see this error:
  > error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

  Make sure to install `libgomp1` library with `sudo apt-get install libgomp1`.

  ---
  1. Open your favorite terminal, and change to the Downloads directory using `cd Downloads`
  2. Make the farmer & node executable
  - `chmod +x subspace-farmer-ubuntu-x86_64-skylake-gemini-3f-2023-aug-18`
  - `chmod +x subspace-node-ubuntu-x86_64-skylake-gemini-3f-2023-aug-18`
  3. We will then start the node using the following command

  ```bash
    # Replace `INSERT_YOUR_ID` with a nickname you choose
    # Copy all of the lines below, they are all part of the same command
    ./subspace-node-ubuntu-x86_64-skylake-gemini-3f-2023-aug-18 \
      --chain gemini-3f \
      --execution wasm \
      --blocks-pruning 256 \
      --state-pruning archive \
      --no-private-ipv4 \
      --validator \
      --name "INSERT_YOUR_ID"
  ```
  4. You should see something similar in the terminal:

## III. Post Node & Farmer Install Care

---

Now that your Node & Farmer have been started you will wait for the node to sync and the farmer to complete the initial plotting. While this is occurring you can check out some of the helpful resources below.

**- [Telemetry Server](https://telemetry.subspace.network/#list/0x92e91e657747c41eeabed5129ff51689d2e935b9f6abfbd5dfcb2e1d0d035095)**


**- [Block Explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc-0.gemini-3f.subspace.network%2Fws#/explorer)**


### Using a Custom Path
You can set a custom path for your node & farmer to use if you want to use an external hard drive, or set a custom path from the default. You can set the node and farmer to different directories if you would like.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="node" label="1.üö© Node">

#### Set Node Custom Path.
To set your node to use a custom path all you will need to do is add the `--base-path` parameter.

```
  # start node and store data in `NODE_DATA_PATH` instead of default location
  ./NODE_FILE_NAME --base-path NODE_DATA_PATH --chain gemini-3f ...`
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Switching to a new snapshot from older/different versions of Subspace

:::info
Unless specifically mentioned by the Development team you should **NOT** have to wipe & purge your configuration on new releases.
:::

In general you should be able to download the latest release, and re-start the Node & Farmer with the same commands as you started to prior version with no errors.

There are some cases where version updates will cause issue with your Node & Farmer and you may have to wipe & purge your node, typically when errors occur. If you have any issues you can always check our [Forums](https://forums.subspace.network) and hop in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/subspace-network) Server to ask for help.

#### Wipe & Purge

If you were running a node previously, and want to switch to a new snapshot, please perform these steps and then follow the guideline again:
```
# Replace `FARMER_FILE_NAME` with the name of the node file you downloaded from releases
./FARMER_FILE_NAME wipe PATH_TO_FARM
# Replace `NODE_FILE_NAME` with the name of the node file you downloaded from releases
./NODE_FILE_NAME purge-chain --chain gemini-3f
```
Does not matter if the node/farmer executable is the previous one or from the new snapshot, both will work :)
The reason we require this is, with every snapshot change, the network might get partitioned, and you may be on a different genesis than the current one.
In plain English, these commands are like a `reset` button for snapshot changes.

Now follow installation guide.

#### Docker Wipe & Purge

In case of Docker setup run `docker-compose down -v` (and manually delete custom directories if you have specified them).

Now follow installation guide.

#### Help

There are extra commands and parameters you can use on farmer or node, use the `--help` after any other command to display additional options.

```bash
# Replace `FARMER_FILE_NAME` with the name of the node file you downloaded from releases
./FARMER_FILE_NAME farm --help
```

## IV. Advanced

---

### Helpful commands examples

- `./FARMER_FILE_NAME info PATH_TO_FARM` : show information about the farm at `PATH_TO_FARM`
- `./FARMER_FILE_NAME scrub PATH_TO_FARM` : Scrub the farm to find and fix farm at `PATH_TO_FARM` corruption
- `./FARMER_FILE_NAME wipe PATH_TO_FARM` : erases everything related to farmer if data were stored in `PATH_TO_FARM`
- `./NODE_FILE_NAME --base-path NODE_DATA_PATH --chain gemini-3f ...` : start node and store data in `NODE_DATA_PATH` instead of default location
- `./NODE_FILE_NAME purge-chain --base-path NODE_DATA_PATH --chain gemini-3f` : erases data related to the node if data were stored in `NODE_DATA_PATH`


### Support for multiple disks

Farm path and size you have seen above can be specified more than once to engage multiple disks.
It is recommended to specify multiple disks explicitly rather than using RAID for better hardware utilization and efficiency.

Example:
```
./FARMER_FILE_NAME farm --reward-address WALLET_ADDRESS \
    path=/media/ssd1,size=100GiB \
    path=/media/ssd2,size=10T \
    path=/media/ssd3,size=10T
```

### Build from source (Linux)

If you're running unsupported Linux distribution or CPU architecture, you may try to build binaries yourself from source.

NOTE: This is primarily targeted at tech-savvy users and not recommended unless you know what you're doing.
Please try to find answer to your question online before reaching out to maintainers.

You'll have to have [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) installed as well as LLVM, Clang and CMake in addition to usual developer tooling (Ubuntu example):
```bash
sudo apt-get install llvm clang cmake
```

Now clone the source and build snapshot `snapshot-2023-aug-18` (replace occurrences with the snapshot you want to build):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/subspace/subspace.git
cd subspace
git checkout snapshot-2023-aug-18
cargo build \
    --profile production \
    --bin subspace-node \
    --bin subspace-farmer
```

You'll find two binaries under `target/production` directory once it succeeds, after which refer to instructions above on how to use them.

## V. Having Trouble?

If you are having some issues with running the node or the farmer for the subspace network, feel free to join our Discord or even better you can take a look at our Forums and review and existing questions or post a new one if needed!

### Enable Rust Backtrace 

When running the Subspace Network Farmer & Node, sometimes you may encounter an error message that includes a line similar to the following:

```
Backtrace omitted. Run with RUST_BACKTRACE=1 environment variable to display it.
```

This error message means that Rust (the programming language that Subspace Network Farmer & Node is written in) has encountered a problem and has provided a diagnostic backtrace that can help diagnose the issue. However, by default, the backtrace is not displayed. To see the backtrace, you need to enable the RUST_BACKTRACE environment variable.

In this section, we will show you how to enable the RUST_BACKTRACE environment variable on Linux, macOS, and Windows (PowerShell).

<Tabs groupId="OS">
