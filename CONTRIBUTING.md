## Advanced Fix

This section presumes a better understanding of GitHub, and programming basics.

For larger, more advanced fixes please ensure you follow the basic principles below.
* Do **not** comment simple trivial code such as importing existing components, and basic HTML/CSS.
* Do comment on complex non-trivial code, complex logic should be easy to understand.
* All public functions need to be commented.
* If code is trivial but could be forgotten over time, please comment.
* Try and think about your code from a 3rd person view, it should make sense to anyone with a similar background in the technology that you are using.
* Sometimes difficult to understand code needs refactoring instead of more comments.
* Make sure the program can still build prior to pull request.

For advanced fixes you should follow the general pathway for GitHub.

1. Create your own fork of the code.
2. Do the changes locally on your system in your preferred development environment.
3. Test your changes locally, ensuring there are no clear edge cases or issues.
4. If you are happy with the changes and think the project could use it, submit a pull request.

# How to report a bug or error

We do not have any strict template that you must follow, but please provide all required information so we can quickly resolve any issues.

* If you find an actual programming bug, please submit a GitHub issue and use the label `bug`.
* If you find a grammar/spelling/content error, please submit a GitHub issue and use the label `documentation`.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

This documentation is for the community, so any feature requests are welcome.
* If you are requesting a feature, please submit a Github issue and use the label `enhancement`
* Explain why this issue is needed, and what problems it will solve.
* Indicate if you are able/willing to help implement this feature.

# Code review process

* The core team will take a look at any pull requests as soon as possible, generally you can expect a response within a day or two.
* If it is a simple and non-controversial fix we will review the code and approve. 
* If there are questions, feedback, or more discussion needs to be had we will reach out to the contributor on the Pull Request to try and resolve said issues.
* If there is no response or activity within 2 weeks of team response we may close the pull request.
