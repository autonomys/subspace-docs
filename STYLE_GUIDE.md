# Terminology Style Guide

## Farm, Farming, and Plotting

### Core Definitions
- **Farm** (noun): The collection of data files stored on disk (never "plot")
- **Farming**: The ongoing process of proving challenges to earn rewards
- **Plotting**: The process of creating original sector encodings of the blockchain history
- **Replotting**: The process of creating replacement sector encodings

### Usage Rules

#### 1. Never use "plot" as a noun
- ✗ "Store your plot on an SSD"
- ✓ "Store your farm on an SSD"
- ✗ "The plot is corrupted"
- ✓ "The farm is corrupted"

#### 2. Always use "plotting/replotting" for the creation process
- ✓ "GPU plotting allows faster farm generation"
- ✓ "CPU plotting is the main bottleneck"
- ✓ "Replotting updates your existing farms"
- ✗ "Refarming" (never use this term)

#### 3. "Farm" replaces "plot" in all noun contexts
- plot size → farm size
- plot storage → farm storage
- saving the plot → saving the farm

#### 4. "Farming" refers only to the reward-earning process
- ✓ "Farming is not demanding on the CPU" (proving challenges)
- ✗ "Farming your drives" (creating farms)

#### 5. Maintain this distinction consistently
- Creation process: plotting, replotting
- Storage/files: farms
- Reward earning: farming

#### 6. Compound terms follow the same rules
- ✓ "farm generation" (result of plotting)
- ✓ "farm creation process" (plotting process)
- ✗ "plot generation" → ✓ "farm generation"

#### 7. Avoid using "farm" as noun and verb in the same sentence
- ✗ "Farms are farmed using your CPU"
- ✗ "Farm your farms to earn rewards"
- ✓ "Farms prove challenges using your CPU"
- ✓ "Use your farms to earn rewards"
- ✓ "Your CPU processes farms to validate blocks"

#### 8. When "farming" must appear near "farm," restructure the sentence
- ✗ "After plotting, farms are ready for farming"
- ✓ "After plotting, your farms can begin proving challenges"
- ✓ "After plotting, you can start farming with your new farms"
- ✓ "After plotting, the farming process can begin"
